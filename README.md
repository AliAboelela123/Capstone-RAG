# FinancialDocumentAIAnalyzer
This is our (Ali Aboelela, Nelson Lee, Kevin Sadigh) capstone project. It can be described generally as a web app which acts as wrapper for a fine tuned LLM. Its main goal is to take in (primarily) financial pdf documents &amp; user queries as input then output a response to said queries. The model should also be able to respond to non-finance related queries & documents, although these queries will be directed to our base model rather than the fine tuned version - so performance is expected to be worse.

Although outside the scope of our capstone project, afer graduating we hope to improve the model such that it's capable of processing STEM research papers & queries at high performance.
