# FinancialDocumentAIAnalyzer
This is our (Ali Aboelela, Nelson Lee, Kevin Sadigh) capstone project. It can be described generally as a web app which acts as wrapper for a fine tuned LLM. Its main goal is to take in (primarily) financial pdf documents &amp; user queries as input then output a response to said queries. Non finance queries are directed to a base version of the LLM.

Although outside the scope of our capstone project, afer graduating we hope to improve the model such that it's capable of processing STEM research papers & queries at high performance.
