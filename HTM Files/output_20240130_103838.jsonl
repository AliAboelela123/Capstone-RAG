A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member\u2019s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan and receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b). (b) | Delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances.  | 2018 |  | 2017 | \n | Net Write-Off Rate |  |  |  | Net Write-Off Rate |  |  | \n | Principal Only(a) |  | Principal, Interest & Fees(a) |  | 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total |  | Principal Only(a) |  | Principal, Interest & Fees(a) |  | 30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total | \nCard Member Loans: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nGlobal Consumer Services Group |  |  | 2.1 | % |  |  | 2.5 | % |  |  | 1.3 | % |  |  | 1.8 | % |  |  | 2.1 | % |  |  | 1.2 | %\nGlobal Small Business Services |  |  | 1.7 | % |  |  | 2.0 | % |  |  | 1.2 | % |  |  | 1.5 | % |  |  | 1.8 | % |  |  | 1.1 | %\nCard Member Receivables: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nGlobal Consumer Services Group |  |  | 1.6 | % |  |  | 1.8 | % |  |  | 1.2 | % |  |  | 1.6 | % |  |  | 1.8 | % |  |  | 1.2 | %\nGlobal Small Business Services |  |  | 1.9 | % |  |  | 2.1 | % |  |  | 1.4 | % |  |  | 1.7 | % |  |  | 1.9 | % |  |  | 1.4 | %  | 2018 |  | 2017 | \n | Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume |  | 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables |  | Net Loss Ratio as a % of Charge Volume |  | 90+ Days Past Billing as a % of Receivables | \nCard Member Receivables: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nGlobal Corporate Payments |  |  | 0.11 | % |  |  | 0.8 | % |  |  | 0.10 | % |  |  | 0.8 | % (a) | We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.

(b) | We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. The net write-off rates and 30+ days past due as a percentage of total for Card Member receivables relate to GCSG and Global Small Business Services (GSBS) Card Member receivables. (c) | Global Corporate Payments (GCP) reflects global, large and middle market corporate accounts. For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member\u2019s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. GCP delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints.  |  | Three Months Ended |  |  | Six Months Ended | \n |  | June 30, |  |  | June 30, | \n(Millions, except percentages and where indicated) |  | 2018 |  |  | 2017 |  |  | 2018 |  |  | 2017 | \nNet interest income |  | $ | 1,829 |  |  | $ | 1,533 |  |  | $ | 3,670 |  |  | $ | 3,035 | \nExclude: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nInterest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(a) |  |  | 359 |  |  |  | 295 |  |  |  | 661 |  |  |  | 542 | \nInterest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio(b) |  |  | (236 | ) |  |  | (156 | ) |  |  | (449 | ) |  |  | (287 | )\nAdjusted net interest income(c) |  | $ | 1,952 |  |  | $ | 1,672 |  |  | $ | 3,882 |  |  | $ | 3,290 | \nAverage Card Member loans(billions) |  | $ | 74.1 |  |  | $ | 65.1 |  |  | $ | 73.5 |  |  | $ | 64.6 | \nNet interest income divided by average Card Member loans(c) |  |  | 9.9 | % |  |  | 9.4 | % |  |  | 10.0 | % |  |  | 9.4 | %\nNet interest yield on average Card Member loans(c) |  |  | 10.6 | % |  |  | 10.3 | % |  |  | 10.6 | % |  |  | 10.3 | % (a) | Primarily represents interest expense attributable to maintaining our corporate liquidity pool and funding Card Member receivables.

(c) | Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to \u201cGlossary of Selected Terminology\u201d for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.  |  | Three Months Ended |  |  |  |  |  | Six Months Ended |  |  |  |

\u00b7 | our delinquency and write-off rates and growth of provisions for losses being higher or lower than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan and receivable balances and delinquencies, mix of balances, loans and receivables related to new Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, credit performance of new and enhanced lending products, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies, collections capabilities and recoveries of previously written-off loans and receivables; \u00b7 | our ability to continue to grow loans, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk, the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, and our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing Card Members\u2019 spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers; \u00b7 | our net interest yield on average Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current expectations, which will be influenced by, among other things, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances, such as paydown rates, Card Member acquisition strategy, product mix, cost of funds and credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, changes in the level of loans at promotional rates and other pricing changes, and changes in deposit rates, which could be impacted by, among other things, changes in benchmark interest rates, competitive pressure and regulatory constraints; \u00b7 | rewards expense and cost of Card Member services growing inconsistently from expectations, which will depend in part on Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns, including the level of spend in bonus categories, and the redemption of rewards and offers, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value proposition we offer; increasing competition, which could result in greater rewards offerings; our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; and the amount we spend on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion; \u00b7 | the actual amount to be spent on marketing and business development, which will be based in part on management\u2019s assessment of competitive opportunities; overall business performance and changes in macroeconomic conditions; the actual amount of advertising and Card Member acquisition costs; our ability to continue to shift Card Member acquisition to digital channels; contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments; management\u2019s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities; and our ability to realize efficiencies, optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending; \u00b7 | our ability to control operating expense growth, which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, or fraud costs; continuing to implement and achieve benefits from reengineering plans, which could be impacted by factors such as an inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions and underestimating hiring and other employee needs; higher than expected employee levels; an inability to innovate efficient channels of customer interactions, such as chat supported by artificial intelligence, or customer acquisition; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management\u2019s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces; greater -than -expected inflation; and the level of M&A activity and related expenses; \u00b7 | our ability to satisfy our commitments to certain of our cobrand partners as part of the ongoing operations of the business, which will be impacted in part by competition, brand perceptions and reputation, and our ability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to current cobrand Card Members and new customers and offer attractive services and rewards programs, which will depend in part on ongoing investments, new product innovation and development, Card Member acquisition efforts and enrollment processes, including through digital channels, and infrastructure to support new products, services and benefits; \u00b7 | changes affecting our plans regarding the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as our capital levels and regulatory capital ratios; changes in the stress testing and capital planning process and the continued non-objection by our primary regulators to our capital plans; the amount of capital required to support asset growth; the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies;\u00a0our results of operations and financial condition;\u00a0and the economic environment and market conditions\u00a0in any given period; \u00b7 | implementation of legislation and additional guidance or context from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department, state and foreign taxing authorities, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or others regarding the Tax Act, and any future changes or amendments to that legislation; \u00b7 | a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, processes or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, which could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data, disrupt our operations, reduce the use and acceptance of American Express cards and lead to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, remediation and response costs, and reputational harm; \u00b7 | our deposit rates increasing faster or slower than current expectations and changes affecting our ability to grow Personal Savings deposits due to market demand, changes in benchmark interest rates, competition or regulatory restrictions on our ability to obtain deposit funding or offer competitive interest rates, which could affect our net interest yield and ability to fund our businesses; \u00b7 | changes in global economic and business conditions, consumer and business spending generally, the availability and cost of capital, unemployment rates, geopolitical conditions, trade policies, foreign currency rates and interest rates, all of which may significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan and receivable balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations; \u00b7 | changes in capital and credit market conditions, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets; or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding or restrict our access to the capital markets; \u00b7 | legal and regulatory developments, which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices, including our ability to continue certain GNS and other partnerships; exert further pressure on the average discount rate and GNS volumes; result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to Card Members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties; materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; or result in harm to the American Express brand; \u00b7 | our funding plan being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions; \u00b7 | changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in GNS or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; and \u00b7 | factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics or terrorism, any of which could significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan and receivable balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions.  |  | Total Number of Shares Purchased |  |  | Average Price Paid Per Share |  |  | Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs(c) |  |  | Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nApril 1-30, 2018 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nRepurchase program(a) |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | 85,002,419 | \nEmployee transactions(b) |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | N/A | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nMay 1-31, 2018 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nRepurchase program(a) |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | 85,002,419 | \nEmployee transactions(b) |  |  | 30,623 |  |  | $ | 99.61 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | N/A | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nJune 1-30, 2018 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nRepurchase program(a) |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | 85,002,419 | \nEmployee transactions(b) |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | N/A | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nTotal |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nRepurchase program(a) |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | 85,002,419 | \nEmployee transactions(b) |  |  | 30,623 |  |  | $ | 99.61 |  |  |  | \u2015 |  |  |  | N/A |  (a) | On September 26, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million shares of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions and the Federal Reserve\u2019s non-objection to our capital plans.
