(\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire\u2019s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect most of our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 and likely will continue to be taken intended to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and early 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods, and services in many parts of the world. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2.\u00a0New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration contracts. The effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, which provides that revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) be applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be recorded in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We also preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as of the transition date will increase our life, health and annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due to the historically low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We, therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 7  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 3.\u00a0Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in fixed maturity securities as of March 31, 2022 and December\u00a031, 2021 are summarized by type below (in millions).

Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d). Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns\n26.6\n% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $\n206\nmillion in the first quarter of 2022 and $\n150\nmillion in 2021. We received dividends on the common stock of $\n130\nmillion in the first quarter of both 2022 and 2021,\u00a0which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $\n12.8\nbillion at March 31, 2022 and $\n11.7\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $\n13.2\nbillion at March 31, 2022 and $\n13.1\nbillion at December 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by\n3\n% of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required as of March 31, 2022.

(\u201cIroquois\u201d). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $\n4.4\nbillion as of March 31, 2022 and $\n4.3\nbillion as of December\u00a031, 2021. We recorded equity method earnings in the first quarter of $\n170\nmillion in 2022 and $\n101\nmillion in 2021, and we received aggregate distributions in the first quarter of $\n28\nmillion in 2022 and $\n896\nmillion in 2021. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a\n50\n% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (\u201cJefferies\u201d) owning the other\n50\n% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia\u2019s operations is through commercial paper, which was $\n1.47\nbillion at March 31, 2022 and is limited to $\n1.5\nbillion. Berkadia\u2019s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) subsidiaries own a\n50\n% noncontrolling interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas and a\n50\n% noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut. 9  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments\n(Continued) We own a\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than\n800\nretail locations across\n44\nU.S. states and\nsix\nCanadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a\n50.1\n% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining\n11.3\n% interest.

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $\n9.7\nbillion in the first three months of 2022 and $\n6.5\nbillion in the first three months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable losses in the first quarter of 2022 were $\n739\nmillion and taxable gains in 2021 were $\n1.8\nbillion. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. As of March 31, 2022, we had six open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of $\n121\nmillion and an aggregate notional value of $\n2.6\nbillion. 10  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 7.\u00a0Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions).

Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims.\nA reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).   2022   2021  Balances at beginning of year:        Gross liabilities $ 86,664   $ 79,854  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  (\n2,960 )   (\n2,912 ) Net liabilities  83,704    76,942  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:        Current accident year  13,375    11,363  Prior accident years  (\n251 )   (\n646 ) Total  13,124    10,717  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses:        Current accident year  (\n3,908 )   (\n3,214 ) Prior accident years  (\n8,091 )   (\n6,454 ) Total  (\n11,999 )   (\n9,668 ) Foreign currency effect  (\n106 )   (\n94 ) Balances at March 31:        Net liabilities  84,723    77,897  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  2,944    3,064  Gross liabilities $ 87,667   $ 80,961   Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (\u201ccurrent accident year\u201d) and events occurring in all prior years (\u201cprior accident years\u201d). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $\n251\nmillion in the first quarter of 2022 and $\n646\nmillion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were\n0.3\n% in 2022 and\n0.8\n% in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $\n114\nmillion in the first quarter of 2022 and $\n699\nmillion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims, partly offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2021 was primarily due to reductions in private passenger automobile estimates, and to a lesser extent in medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation estimates. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $\n137\nmillion in the first quarter of 2022 and increased $\n53\nmillion in 2021. 14  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached.\nReconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) and related deferred charges for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).   2022   2021   Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance   Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance  Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256   $ (\n10,639 )  $ 40,966   $ (\n12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:                Current year contracts  \u2014    \u2014    \u2014    \u2014  Prior years\u2019 contracts  (\n7 )   215    (\n5 )   252  Total  (\n7 )   215    (\n5 )   252  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  (\n547 )   \u2014    (\n276 )   \u2014  Balances at March 31 $ 37,702   $ (\n10,424 )  $ 40,685   $ (\n12,189 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 208       $ 247       In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter for prior years\u2019 contracts were $\n208\nmillion in 2022 and $\n247\nmillion in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAIG\u201d). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $\n15.4\nbillion at March 31, 2022 and $\n15.8\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $\n4.34\nbillion at March 31, 2022 and $\n4.45\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. Note 15.

Notes payable and other borrowings\n(Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $\n600\nmillion of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5\n128.5\nbillion (approximately $\n1.1\nbillion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nand a weighted average interest rate of\n0.5\n%. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $\n4.5\nbillion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n3.4\n% and \u20ac\n1.25\nbillion (approximately $\n1.4\nbillion) of senior notes maturing in\n2030\nand\n2034\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n1.8\n%. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (\u20ac\n8.15\nbillion, \u00a3\n1.75\nbillion and \u00a5\n914\nbillion par at March 31, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $\n716\nmillion in the first quarter of 2022 and $\n720\nmillion in the first quarter of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $\n3.8\nbillion at March 31, 2022. Generally, Berkshire\u2019s guarantee of a subsidiary\u2019s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.6\n% senior notes due in\n2053\nand a subsidiary issued \u00a3\n350\nmillion of\n3.25\n% bonds due in\n2052\n. BNSF\u2019s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. As of March 31, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $\n10.4\nbillion at March 31, 2022, which included approximately $\n8.8\nbillion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a016.

Fair value measurements\n(Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level\u00a01\n\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level\u00a02\n\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level\u00a01 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level\u00a03\n\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a017.

Class\u00a0B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to\none-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\u00a0of such rights of Class\u00a0A common stock. Each Class\u00a0B common share possesses voting rights equal to\none-ten-thousandth\n(1/10,000)\u00a0of the voting rights of a Class\u00a0A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class\u00a0A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into\n1,500\nshares of Class\u00a0B common stock. Class\u00a0B common stock is not convertible into Class\u00a0A common stock. On an equivalent Class\u00a0A common stock basis, there were\n1,470,875\nshares outstanding as of March 31, 2022 and\n1,477,429\nshares outstanding as of December\u00a031, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class\u00a0A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class\u00a0B shares outstanding. Class\u00a0B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\nof a Class\u00a0A share. Average equivalent Class\u00a0A shares outstanding represents average Class\u00a0A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\nof the average Class\u00a0B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class\u00a0B shares outstanding represents average Class\u00a0B shares outstanding plus\n1,500\ntimes the average Class\u00a0A shares outstanding. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\nThe program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $\n30\nbillion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class\u00a0A or Class\u00a0B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note\u00a018. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were\n18.0\n% in the first quarter 2022 and\n18.5\n% in the first quarter of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a019.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire\u00a0subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On\nMarch 21, 2022\n, Berkshire and Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) entered into an agreement whereby Berkshire will acquire all of Alleghany\u2019s outstanding common stock for cash of approximately $\n11.6\nbillion. The acquisition of Alleghany is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to approval by Alleghany shareholders and the receipt of various regulatory approvals. Alleghany owns property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses. 20  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a022. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.\nThe following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in\u00a0millions).

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect most of our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 and likely will continue to be taken to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and early 2022 included periodic temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to the disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for goods and services in many parts of the world. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting produced after-tax earnings of $47 million in the first quarter of 2022 versus $764 million in 2021. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by ongoing increases in claims severities at GEICO. Underwriting earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of the premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program and the favorable impact of lower claims frequencies for private passenger automobile coverages, which were partially offset by higher claims severities. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to lower dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit, partly offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher average fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 6.7% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher earnings from the regulated utilities businesses, including increased production tax credits for renewable energy, and from higher earnings from tax equity investments, partly offset by lower earnings from the natural gas pipelines and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 15.5% in the first quarter of 2022 versus 2021. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in the first quarter of 2022, we continue to experience the effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 23  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100\u00a0million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first quarters included floods in Australia in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of March 31, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims. The effects of the pandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO\u2019s pre-tax underwriting loss in the first quarter of 2022 reflected increased claims severity, primarily due to significant cost inflation in automobile markets, which accelerated in the second half of 2021. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to increased claims severity on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher than general inflation rates. Premiums written in the first quarter of 2022 increased $259 million (2.6%) compared to 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, as average policies in-force were relatively unchanged. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2022 increased $631 million (7.1%) compared to 2021. Premiums earned in 2021 included a reduction of approximately $400 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased $2.1 billion (32.2%) compared to 2021. GEICO\u2019s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned in the first quarter of 2022 was 89.4%, an increase of 17.0 percentage points compared to 2021, which reflected increases in claims frequencies and severities. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (ten to eleven percent range), collision (fifteen to sixteen percent range), bodily injury (twelve to thirteen percent range) and personal injury (fourteen to fifteen percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2022 were higher for property damage coverage (six to seven percent range), collision coverage (twenty to twenty-two percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). GEICO\u2019s losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events of $92 million in 2022 and $521 million in 2021. The reduction in estimates for prior years\u2019 events in 2022 reflected decreases for bodily and personal injury coverages and increases for collision and property damage coverages. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2022 were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $249 million (17.3%) compared to 2021, reflecting lower employee-related and advertising expenses. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2022 was 12.5% compared to 16.1% in 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary\u2019s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d), National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d).

The increases were across multiple coverages and occurred in several markets. 25  Item\n2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary\u2019s loss ratio was 72.9% in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared to 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $75 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $150 million in 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $22 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $178 million in 2021 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events. BH Primary insurers also write significant levels of workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. We could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased $153 million (25.5%) compared to 2021. Our expense ratio also increased 1.6 percentage points compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG\u2019s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $100 million (4.2%) and the loss ratio declined 3.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events in the first quarter of 2022 were $315 million, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $137 million. Losses incurred in the first quarter of 2021 included $310 million from significant catastrophe events and an increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $53 million. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio decreased 4.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects.

First Quarter       2022   2021           Amount   %   Amount   %  Premiums written         $ 1,243       $ 1,301      Premiums earned         $ 1,248    100.0   $ 1,305    100.0  Life and health insurance benefits          1,051    84.2    1,251    95.9  Underwriting expenses          209    16.8    226    17.3  Total benefits and expenses          1,260    101.0    1,477    113.2  Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss)         $ (12 )      $ (172 )     Life/health premiums written decreased $58 million (4.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower volumes in the Asia Pacific and North America regions and from unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits in the first quarter of 2022 declined $200 million (16.0%) compared to 2021, attributable to lower mortality. Underwriting results in 2021 were affected by significant, pandemic-related increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa and Latin America, which were partially offset by lower underwriting expenses, due mainly to lower average commission rates in the international life business. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were insignificant. Pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter before foreign currency exchange effects were $195 million in 2022 and $243 million in 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $37.7 billion at March 31, 2022, declining $554 million since December 31, 2021, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $10.4 billion at March 31, 2022, a decline of $215 million since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $25 million (17.4%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. 27  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity (Continued) Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results in the first quarter included foreign currency gains of $44 million in 2022 and losses of $10 million in 2021. Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $147 million in 2022 compared to $126 million in 2021. The increase in pre-tax losses reflected the effects of new business and lower mortality. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.3 billion at March 31, 2022 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of $56 million in 2022 and $121 million in 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in each period were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and in 2022 were partly offset by unfavorable changes in securities markets. Insurance\u2014Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).    First Quarter   Percentage       2022   2021   Change  Interest and other investment income     $ 164   $ 159    3.1 % Dividend income      1,197    1,253    (4.5 ) Pre-tax net investment income      1,361    1,412    (3.6 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests      191    204      Net investment income     $ 1,170   $ 1,208      Effective income tax rate      14.1 %   14.4 %     Interest and other investment income increased 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, rates began to increase in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of such increases are expected to be reflected in our earnings as maturing investments are replaced by new investments. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Dividend income in the first quarter of 2022 decreased 4.5% compared to 2021. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income in the first quarter included $16 million in 2022 and $38 million in 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $148 billion at March 31, 2022 and $147 billion at December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative. 28  Item 2.

Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (\u201cBNSF\u201d) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad\n(Continued) The following table summarizes BNSF\u2019s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands).        Cars/Units          First Quarter   Percentage        2022   2021   Change  Consumer products       1,275    1,393    (8.5 )% Industrial products       404    399    1.3  Agricultural products       305    318    (4.1 ) Coal       385    339    13.6         2,369    2,449    (3.3 ) Railroad operating revenues increased 10.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 13.8% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, along with increased rates per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in unit volume. Pre-tax earnings were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 9.0% compared to 2021. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10.3% from 2021. The increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 8.5%. The volume decrease was mainly from lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain challenges and lower automotive shipments due to production impacts from a global microchip shortage, partially offset by an increase in domestic intermodal volumes. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5.8% from 2021. Volumes increased 1.3% in the first quarter along with higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.7% compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by decreased volumes of 4.1%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities. Operating revenues from coal were $889 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 29.6% from 2021, attributable to higher volumes of 13.6%, as well as from higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2022 derived from increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $408 million (12.3%) compared to 2021, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits and fuel expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 0.9 percentage points to 64.6% versus 2021. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $60 million (5.2%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $311 million (56.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $35 million (7.1%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased general inflation and higher casualty costs. 30  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE\u2019s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings decreased $39 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). The increase in operating expenses reflected incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service as well as higher thermal plant maintenance costs. PacifiCorp\u2019s utility margin was $832 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $14 million from 2021. The increase reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and favorable price impacts, and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased 1.9% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, the favorable impact of weather and higher customer usage. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $97 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and the impacts of ratemaking. MEC\u2019s electric utility margin was $483 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 23% versus 2021. The increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale customer volumes and lower purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.6% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses and a higher comparative accrual for earnings sharing. NV Energy\u2019s electric utility margin was $306 million in the first quarter of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 4.0% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and higher customer usage, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid\u2019s after-tax earnings increased $7 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflected the impacts of higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2022. Natural gas pipelines\u2019 after-tax earnings decreased $74 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was largely due to higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $111 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in earnings was primarily due to improved wind tax equity investment earnings of $118 million. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings was primarily due to losses on pre-existing tax equity investments in the first quarter of 2021 due to the February 2021 winter storms, as well as from increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $63 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume and in refinancing activity, and to a lesser extent lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units at existing companies. 32  Item 2.

(\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). 33  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Revenues of the industrial products group in the first quarter of 2022 increased $803 million (12.0%) compared to 2021 while pre-tax earnings increased $74 million (6.5%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.3% for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. PCC\u2019s revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 12.7% over the first quarter of 2021.  PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 reflected higher aerospace product revenues and relatively unchanged revenues from power and other industrial products. While commercial air travel continues to increase in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel. However, further recovery likely will continue to be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of the virus. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers appear to be increasing, most notably for narrow-body aircraft, although Boeing\u2019s growth is constrained by the lack of certification of the Boeing 737 MAX in China. In addition, the pause in deliveries of the Boeing 787 due to production quality issues further impacts aerospace growth. PCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased $16 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of increased revenues, partially offset by a $13 million reduction in pension plan income. The improvement in operating results also reflects the continual actions taken by management to improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC\u2019s products. We do not currently expect PCC\u2019s aerospace revenues or earnings will increase significantly in the near term, primarily due to the expected lag in recovery of PCC\u2019s manufacturing levels as a result of inventory levels within the supply chain for Boeing, and the potential for delays with the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX in China and the resumption of Boeing 787 production. Lubrizol\u2019s revenues were approximately $1.65 billion in the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 2.5% compared to 2021. The decrease reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol\u2019s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was due to escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 39.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs and lower sales volumes and higher expenses arising from the unplanned temporary shutdowns. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shutdown of Additives facilities in the U.S., which resulted in various incremental and non-recurring operating costs and lost sales margins. Marmon\u2019s revenues were $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 26.2% compared to 2021, with nearly all business groups generating meaningful revenue increases. In particular, aggregate revenues in the first quarter of 2022 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Transportation groups increased 39% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average metals prices and sales volumes. These groups contributed over half of Marmon\u2019s revenue increase. Marmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 43.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher earnings from most business groups, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Medical groups. The Electrical, Transportation and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups generated the largest increases in earnings in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved operating margins. IMC\u2019s revenues were $960 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2021. Revenues in the first quarter of 2022 reflected increased sales in most geographic regions, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 8.3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, attributable to higher customer demand, partially offset by higher raw material costs and other operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 34  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Building products (Continued) Revenues of the building products group increased $1.1 billion (19.3%) in the first quarter of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $374 million (48.6%) compared to 2021. Residential housing construction demand in the U.S. continued to be relatively strong in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be negatively affected by persistent supply chain disruptions, which limited our sales and contributed to production delays in some areas and contributed to significant cost increases for many raw materials and other inputs, including energy, freight and labor. These effects necessitated sales price increases. In the first quarter of 2022, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly compared to the previous low-rate environment. Significant increases in mortgage interest rates will likely slow demand for new housing construction, which could adversely impact our businesses. Clayton Homes\u2019 revenues increased 21.3% to approximately $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $470 million (26.6%), primarily due to higher average selling prices and changes in sales mix. New home unit sales increased 4.3% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher factory-built manufactured home unit and essentially unchanged site-built home unit sales. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 3.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $19.4\u00a0billion as of March 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $600 million from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $94 million (24.0%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margins and net interest income and relatively low credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $592 million (17.8%) versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes and product mix changes for paint and coatings and commercial flooring, and strength in residential and retail insulation, commercial roofing systems and engineered products. These volume increases were partially offset by lower residential flooring products volumes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $280 million (73.9%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 5.4 percentage points versus 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from a pre-tax gain of $94 million from a business divestiture. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and produced incremental production and other operating costs. Customer demand was generally strong in 2022. However, earnings were negatively impacted from the lack of availability of certain materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products revenues increased approximately $621 million (17.2%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher average selling prices and a 6.5% increase in unit sales. Revenues of our other consumer products businesses in 2022 were generally lower than the first quarter of 2021, including a 3.5% decrease from apparel and footwear, as well as lower revenues from Duracell. These decreases reflected lower sales volumes, partly attributable to reduced inventory availability arising from production slowdowns in Asia, inbound freight delays and shortages of certain raw materials, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $60 million (11.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 versus 2021 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.5 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Aggregate earnings from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses declined about 50% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. These declines were attributable to significant increases in raw material, freight, labor and other operating costs and the impact of reduced sales volumes. 35  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).     First Quarter       2022   2021  Revenues            Service     $ 4,523   $ 3,605  Retailing      4,592    4,353  McLane      12,515    11,622       $ 21,630   $ 19,580  Pre-tax earnings            Service     $ 724   $ 590  Retailing      411    348  McLane      82    103       $ 1,217   $ 1,041  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues            Service      16.0 %   16.4 % Retailing      9.0 %   8.0 % McLane      0.7 %   0.9 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased $918 million (25.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 28.9% in the first quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 23.5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased training hours (38%), customer flight hours (36%) and fuel surcharges due to significant increases in fuel prices, partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $134 million (22.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected increases from TTI, partially offset by lower earnings from aviation services. The earnings increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and improved operating cost leverage. The earnings decrease from aviation services was attributable to higher subcontracted flight, equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increase in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 65% of our combined retailing revenue in the first quarter of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first quarter of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 36  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retailing group revenues increased approximately $239 million (5.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 9.5% over the first quarter of 2021, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2021. The increase in vehicle sales was primarily attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by original equipment manufacturers, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 1.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average selling prices and lower transaction volumes. Retailing group pre-tax earnings increased $63 million (18.1%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 27.4% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle sales margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold, lower floorplan interest expense and from operating cost control efforts. Pre-tax earnings from BHA\u2019s dealership operations increased 41.5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from the jewelry retailers, partly offset by lower earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 62% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues increased $893 million (7.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases of 3.6% from the grocery business and 15.9% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (20.4%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, which was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and fuel expense, partly offset by a slight increase in the average gross sales margin rate. McLane\u2019s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, higher inventory costs and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the personnel shortages that we have been experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in\u00a0millions).   First Quarter    2022   2021  Investment gains (losses)  $ (1,735 )  $ 5,211  Derivative contract gains (losses)   (243 )   489  Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (1,978 )   5,700  Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (398 )   1,007  Net earnings (loss)  $ (1,580 )  $ 4,693  Effective income tax rate   16.0 %   18.8 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in the first quarter included net unrealized losses of $1.8 billion in 2022 and net unrealized gains of $4.6 billion in 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in the first quarter, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were losses of $739 million in 2022 and gains of $1.8 billion in 2021. 37  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses\n(Continued) Investment gains/losses (Continued) We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated before March of 2008. As of March 31, 2022, the vast majority of these contracts have expired. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the related equity securities markets. As of March 31, 2022, the intrinsic value of our remaining equity index put option contracts was $84 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $121 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).     First Quarter       2022   2021  Equity method earnings     $ 307   $ 214  Acquisition accounting expenses      (161 )   (180 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects      (70 )   (80 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes      522    525  Other Berkshire corporate      79    (6 )      $ 677   $ 473   After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Earnings in the first quarter of 2022 increased $93 million versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz and Pilot. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire\u2019s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire\u2019s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC\u2019s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at March 31, 2022 was $508.1\u00a0billion, an increase of $1.9 billion since December 31, 2021. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $5.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $1.4\u00a0billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30\u00a0billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class\u00a0A and B common stock. 38  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition\n(Continued) At March 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $102.7 billion, which included $74.1\u00a0billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $412.3\u00a0billion. During the first quarter of 2022, we paid cash of $51.1 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $9.7 billion from sales of equity securities. Our consolidated borrowings at March 31, 2022 were $119.7 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $7.4 billion in the aggregate. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt outstanding at March 31, 2022 was $21.3 billion, a decrease of $122 million since December\u00a031, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire\u2019s borrowings decreased $650 million in the first quarter of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Aggregate maturities of Berkshire parent company debt over the next twelve months approximates $3.9 billion, all of which is in the first quarter of 2023. Berkshire\u2019s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $23.6\u00a0billion at March 31, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $18.9 billion. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued \u20ac1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the second quarter of 2022 are $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $23.0 billion as of March 31, 2022, a decrease of $201 million from December 31, 2021. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion at March 31, 2022, substantially unchanged from December\u00a031, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053 and a subsidiary issued \u00a3350 million of 3.25% notes due in 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $6.8 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $2.2 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $9.4\u00a0billion over the remainder of 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at March 31, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of March 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. 39  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations\n(Continued) On March 21, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion, subject to Alleghany shareholder approval and receipt of various regulatory approvals. We currently anticipate this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $125.4 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of March 31, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit\u2019s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 40  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item\u00a03. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the \u201cMarket Risk Disclosures\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of March 31, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Item\u00a04. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item\u00a01. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item\u00a01A to Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 41  Item\u00a02.

(\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire\u2019s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and during 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2.\u00a0New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration contracts. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, whereby revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) are applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be recorded in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We currently estimate that as of January 1, 2021, the adoption of ASU 2018-12 will reduce our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity between $\n6\nbillion and $\n7\nbillion from the amount previously reported, primarily due to the low interest rate environment at that time.

Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors and agreed to passivity commitments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we have not applied the equity method of accounting with respect to our investment in American Express and continue to record our investment at fair value. Our equity security investments also include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\u201cOccidental\u201d) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $\n10\nbillion and warrants to purchase up to\n83.86\nmillion shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $\n59.62\nper share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at\n8\n% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in\n2029\nat a redemption price equal to\n105\n% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. Dividends on the preferred stock are payable in cash or, at Occidental\u2019s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. During the first six months of 2022, we also acquired approximately\n17\n% of the outstanding common stock of Occidental, which had a fair value of $\n9.3\nbillion as of June 30, 2022. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d). Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns\n26.6\n% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $\n71\nmillion in the second quarter and $\n277\nmillion in the first six months of 2022. We recorded an equity method loss of $\n7\nmillion in the second quarter and earnings of $\n143\nmillion in the first six months of 2021. We received dividends on the common stock of $\n260\nmillion in the first six months of both 2022 and 2021,\u00a0which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $\n12.4\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n11.7\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $\n13.0\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n13.1\nbillion at December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by\n5\n% of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment as of June 30, 2022. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required.

(\u201cIroquois\u201d). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $\n4.5\nbillion as of June 30, 2022 and $\n4.3\nbillion as of December\u00a031, 2021. We recorded equity method earnings from these entities in the first six months of $\n330\nmillion in 2022 and $\n255\nmillion in 2021. We received aggregate distributions in the first six months of $\n137\nmillion in 2022 and $\n982\nmillion in 2021, including a special distribution received from Pilot of $\n849\nmillion in the first quarter of 2021. Additional information concerning these investments follows. 9  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments\n(Continued) We own a\n50\n% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (\u201cJefferies\u201d) owning the other\n50\n% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia\u2019s operations is through commercial paper, which was $\n1.47\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and is limited to $\n1.5\nbillion. Berkadia\u2019s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) subsidiaries own\n50\n% noncontrolling interests in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas, and Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut. We own a\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than\n800\nretail locations across\n44\nU.S. states and\nsix\nCanadian provinces and is a leading supplier of fuel to third parties. The Haslam family currently owns a\n50.1\n% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining\n11.3\n% interest. We have an agreement to acquire an additional\n41.4\n% interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a\n20\n% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $\n12.0\nbillion in the first six months of 2022 and $\n8.6\nbillion in the first six months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $\n76\nmillion in the second quarter of 2022 and taxable losses of $\n663\nmillion in the first six months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $\n228\nmillion in the second quarter and $\n2.0\nbillion in the first six months of 2021. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. As of June 30, 2022, we had six open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of $\n186\nmillion and an aggregate notional value of $\n2.5\nbillion. 10  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 7.\u00a0Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions).

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims.\nA reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).   2022   2021  Balances at beginning of year:        Gross liabilities $ 86,664   $ 79,854  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  (\n2,960 )   (\n2,912 ) Net liabilities  83,704    76,942  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:        Current accident year  27,427    23,651  Prior accident years  (\n887 )   (\n1,064 ) Total  26,540    22,587  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses:        Current accident year  (\n10,085 )   (\n8,406 ) Prior accident years  (\n13,820 )   (\n11,169 ) Total  (\n23,905 )   (\n19,575 ) Foreign currency effect  (\n568 )   31  Balances at June 30:        Net liabilities  85,771    79,985  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  2,789    2,973  Gross liabilities $ 88,560   $ 82,958   Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (\u201ccurrent accident year\u201d) and events occurring in all prior years (\u201cprior accident years\u201d). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first six months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $\n887\nmillion in 2022 and $\n1.1\nbillion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were\n1.1\n% in 2022 and\n1.4\n% in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance in the first six months were reduced by $\n313\nmillion in 2022 and $\n1.1\nbillion in 2021. The reductions in each period derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims and in 2022 were partly offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years attributable to property and casualty reinsurance in the first six months decreased $\n574\nmillion in 2022 and increased $\n35\nmillion in 2021. 14  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached.\nReconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) and related deferred charges for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).   2022   2021   Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance   Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance  Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256   $ (\n10,639 )  $ 40,966   $ (\n12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:                Current year contracts  \u2014    \u2014    82    \u2014  Prior years\u2019 contracts  (\n14 )   426    (\n3 )   473  Total  (\n14 )   426    79    473  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  (\n1,008 )   \u2014    (\n808 )   \u2014  Balances at June 30 $ 37,234   $ (\n10,213 )  $ 40,237   $ (\n11,968 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 412       $ 552       In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months for prior years\u2019 contracts were $\n412\nmillion in 2022 and $\n470\nmillion in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAIG\u201d). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $\n15.2\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n15.8\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $\n4.24\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n4.45\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. Note 15.

Notes payable and other borrowings\n(Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $\n600\nmillion of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5\n128.5\nbillion (approximately $\n1.1\nbillion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nand a weighted average interest rate of\n0.5\n%. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $\n4.5\nbillion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n3.4\n% and \u20ac\n1.25\nbillion (approximately $\n1.4\nbillion) of senior notes maturing in\n2030\nand\n2034\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n1.8\n%. In May 2022, BHFC repaid $\n775\nmillion of maturing senior notes. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (\u20ac\n8.15\nbillion, \u00a3\n1.75\nbillion and \u00a5\n914\nbillion par at June 30, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $\n1.4\nbillion in the second quarter and $\n2.1\nbillion in the first six months of 2022 as compared to pre-tax losses of $\n45\nmillion in the second quarter and pre-tax gains of $\n675\nmillion in the first six months of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $\n3.8\nbillion at June 30, 2022. Generally, Berkshire\u2019s guarantee of a subsidiary\u2019s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.6\n% senior notes due in\n2053\n. During the first six months of 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of\n3.5\n% and maturity dates ranging from\n2024\nto\n2052\n. BNSF\u2019s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2022, BNSF issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.45\n% debentures due in\n2053\n. During the first six months of 2022, BNSF repaid $\n800\nmillion of term debt. As of June 30, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $\n10.3\nbillion at June 30, 2022, which included approximately $\n8.8\nbillion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a016.

Fair value measurements\n(Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level\u00a01\n\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level\u00a02\n\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level\u00a01 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level\u00a03\n\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a017.

Class\u00a0B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to\none-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\u00a0of such rights of Class\u00a0A common stock. Each Class\u00a0B common share possesses voting rights equal to\none-ten-thousandth\n(1/10,000)\u00a0of the voting rights of a Class\u00a0A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class\u00a0A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into\n1,500\nshares of Class\u00a0B common stock. Class\u00a0B common stock is not convertible into Class\u00a0A common stock. On an equivalent Class\u00a0A common stock basis, there were\n1,468,461\nshares outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and\n1,477,429\nshares outstanding as of December\u00a031, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class\u00a0A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class\u00a0B shares outstanding. Class\u00a0B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\nof a Class\u00a0A share. Average equivalent Class\u00a0A shares outstanding represents average Class\u00a0A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\nof the average Class\u00a0B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class\u00a0B shares outstanding represents average Class\u00a0B shares outstanding plus\n1,500\ntimes the average Class\u00a0A shares outstanding. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\nThe program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $\n30\nbillion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class\u00a0A or Class\u00a0B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note\u00a018. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were\n21.8\n% in the second quarter and\n22.4\n% in the first six months of 2022 compared to\n20.4\n% in the second quarter and\n19.9\n% in the first six months of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a019.

Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger dated as of\nMarch 20, 2022\n, whereby Berkshire will acquire all of Alleghany\u2019s outstanding common stock for cash of approximately $\n11.6\nbillion. The Alleghany shareholders voted to approve and adopt the agreement and plan of merger on June 9, 2022. The acquisition of Alleghany is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to the receipt of various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Alleghany owns property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Greg Abel, Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $\n870\nmillion. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholders agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE\u2019s non-controlling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $\n362\nmillion to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest. 20  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a022. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.\nThe following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 and 2021 (in millions).

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. In varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and during 2022 included periodic temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have developed in 2022. While direct losses to-date have not been material to consolidated results, these events had indirect impacts by contributing to the disruptions of global supply chains, resulting in cost increases for goods and services in parts of the world where we operate. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings increased $205 million (54.5%) in the second quarter and decreased $512 million (44.9%) in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. In each period, underwriting earnings from GEICO declined, primarily attributable to increases in claims frequencies and severities and lower reductions of ultimate claim estimates for prior years\u2019 losses. Underwriting earnings in 2022 from reinsurance activities increased compared to 2021, reflecting foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities on insurance contracts of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and improved life results. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased 56.4% in the second quarter and 26.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 9.8% in the second quarter and 9.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. These increases reflected higher revenue per car/unit, partly offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 3.5% in the second quarter and 5.1% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected higher earnings from tax equity investments and from the natural gas pipeline and Northern Powergrid businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 8.2% in the second quarter and 11.6% in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. Results were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in the first six months of 2022, we continue to experience the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or in evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange gains related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2022, compared to after-tax losses of $45 million and after-tax gains of $480 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively. 24  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100\u00a0million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first six months included floods in Australia and South Africa in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $126 billion as of June 30, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While the effects of the pandemic on underwriting results in the first six months of 2022 were insignificant, results in future periods may be affected by legal and regulatory actions pertaining to insurance coverage, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO\u2019s pre-tax underwriting loss in the first half of 2022 reflected increased claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in automobile markets, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to increased claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher than general inflation rates. Premiums written increased $186 million (2.0%) in the second quarter and $445 million (2.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in policies in-force. Premiums earned increased $261 million (2.7%) in the second quarter and $892 million (4.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Premiums earned in the first six months of 2021 included a reduction of approximately $460 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.5 billion (19.5%) in the second quarter and $3.6 billion (25.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO\u2019s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 92.8% in the second quarter and 91.2% in the first six months of 2022, increases of 13.0 percentage points and 15.0 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, which reflected increases in claims frequencies and severities for the current year and lower reductions of loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (four to five percent range), collision (ten to eleven percent range), bodily injury (six to seven percent range) and personal injury (seven to eight percent range). Average claims severities in the first six months of 2022 were higher for property damage coverage (eleven to twelve percent range), collision coverage (nineteen to twenty percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events of $207 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $846 million in the first six months of 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases for bodily and personal injury coverages, partially offset by increases for collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Underwriting expenses decreased $114 million (8.7%) in the second quarter and $363 million (13.2%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower advertising costs in both periods and lower employee-related costs in the first six months. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 12.2% in the second quarter and first six months of 2022, decreases of 1.4 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, attributable to both the decreases in expenses as well as the increases in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary\u2019s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d), National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d).

The increases were primarily on property and casualty coverages in the U.S. across several markets. 26  Item\n2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary\u2019s loss ratio was 67.7% in the second quarter and 70.2% in the first six months of 2022, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points in the second quarter and relatively unchanged in the first six months compared to 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses from significant catastrophe events were $75 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $156 million in 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events of $106 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $253 million in 2021. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. We could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses increased $194 million (30.6%) in the second quarter and $347 million (28.1%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The expense ratio increased 2.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.8 percentage points in the first six months compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity business due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such business, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG\u2019s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written increased $733 million (21.4%) in the second quarter and $736 million (9.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting net increases from new property business and rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $229 million (10.0%) in the second quarter and $329 million (7.0%) in the first six months, while the loss ratio declined 10.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 6.6 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events were $443 million in the second quarter and $758 million in the first six months of 2022, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $437 million in the second quarter and $574 million in the first six months. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were $108 million in the second quarter and $418 million in the first six months of 2021. Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events were relatively insignificant in the second quarter and first six months of 2021. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 11.6 percentage points in the second quarter and 7.8 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $308 million in the second quarter and $389 million in the first six months of 2022, primarily related to a third quarter 2021 intercompany reinsurance agreement in which a non-U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary ceded non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities to a U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary. Under U.S. GAAP, the effects of exchange rate changes from the remeasurement of liabilities assumed by the U.S. subsidiary are reflected in earnings as its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The net foreign currency exchange rate effects from translating the financial statements of the non-U.S. subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar are included in other comprehensive income.

Life and health benefits declined $271 million (21.9%) in the second quarter and $471 million (18.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to lower mortality. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant, pandemic-related increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains were $157 million in the first six months of 2022, substantially all of which was in the second quarter. Foreign currency exchange gains/losses were insignificant in the corresponding 2021 periods. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $204 million in the second quarter and $399 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $220 million in the second quarter and $463 million in the first six months of 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2022 to $37.2 billion at June 30, 2022, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $426 million in the first six months of 2022 to $10.2 billion at June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. 28  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $45 million (36.6%) in the second quarter and $70 million (26.2%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $116 million in the second quarter and $160 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to losses of $10 million in the second quarter and $20 million in the first six months of 2021. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $143 million in the second quarter and $290 million in the first six months of 2022 and $134 million in the second quarter and $260 million in the first six months of 2021. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.4 billion at June 30, 2022 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $5 million in the second quarter and gains of $51 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to pre-tax gains of $4 million in the second quarter and $125 million in the first six months of 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and changes in securities markets which were unfavorable in 2022 and favorable in 2021. Insurance\u2014Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).  Second Quarter   First Six Months   Percentage Change   2022   2021   2022   2021   Second Quarter   First Six Months  Dividend income $ 2,055   $ 1,298   $ 3,252   $ 2,551    58.3 %   27.5 % Interest and other investment income  228    158    392    317    44.3    23.7  Pre-tax net investment income  2,283    1,456    3,644    2,868    56.8    27.1  Income taxes and noncontrolling interests  377    237    568    441          Net investment income $ 1,906   $ 1,219   $ 3,076   $ 2,427          Effective income tax rate  16.5 %   16.3 %   15.6 %   15.4 %         Dividend income increased 58.3% in the second quarter and 27.5% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during the first six months of 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $13 million in the second quarter and $29 million in the first six months of 2022 and $37 million in the second quarter and $75 million in the first six months of 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased 44.3% in the second quarter and 23.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, interest rates began to increase during 2022. The effects of such increases are expected to be reflected in our earnings as maturing investments are replaced by new investments. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 29  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Investment Income\n(Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2022 and 2021, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative.

Railroad operating revenues reflected lower volumes of 5.6% in the second quarter and 4.5% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased 8.7% in the second quarter and 8.9% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.5 billion in the second quarter and $4.5 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 17.6% and 14.1%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 7.4% in the second quarter and 7.9% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain disruptions, partially offset by modest increases in domestic intermodal and automotive volumes. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 7.8% and 6.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 3.9% in the second quarter and 1.6% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to a decrease in petroleum shipments related to lower demand for crude by rail and network challenges, with the decrease in the first six months partially offset by increased volumes in other product categories. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $2.7 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 9.1% and 6.4%, respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by decreased volumes of 3.2% in the second quarter and 3.6% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of renewable diesel and oil feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 30.2% and 29.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased 2.9% in the second quarter primarily due to network challenges, while volumes increased 5.0% in the first six months of 2022 due to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $4.1 billion in the second quarter and $7.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $687 million (20.3%) and $1.1 billion (16.3%), respectively, compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 2.8 percentage points to 63.2% in the second quarter and 1.9 percentage points to 63.9% in the first six months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $68 million (5.9%) in the second quarter and $128 million (5.5%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $583 million (84.1%) in the second quarter and $894 million (71.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. 31  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE\u2019s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings decreased $143 million in the second quarter and $182 million in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses and lower income tax benefits mainly from lower production tax credits recognized, partially offset by slight increases in utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). The increases in operating expenses reflected higher costs associated with wildfires, higher general and plant maintenance costs and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp\u2019s utility margin was $863 million in the second quarter and $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $6 million and $20 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2021. The increases reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing, partially offset by lower operating revenue from decreases in retail customer volumes and higher thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes decreased 3.3% in the second quarter and 0.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather and lower customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the second quarter and increased $90 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase for the first six months reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms as well as incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC\u2019s electric utility margin was $551 million in the second quarter and $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 14% and 18%, respectively, versus 2021. The increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from increased retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by higher purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.3% in the second quarter and 4.4% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the second quarter and $12 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher comparative accruals for earnings sharing and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy\u2019s electric utility margin was $404 million in the second quarter and $710 million in the first six months of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.4% in the second quarter and 2.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and higher customer usage, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid\u2019s after-tax earnings increased $96 million in the second quarter and $103 million in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021, reflecting the impact on deferred income taxes in 2021 from an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2022. Earnings in each period of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Natural gas pipelines\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $88 million in the second quarter and $14 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher earnings at BHE GT&S, largely from favorable state income tax adjustments, the impacts of an agreement in principle related to a general rate case and lower operating expenses. The year-to-date increase was offset by higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $81 million in the second quarter and $192 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings were primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $40 million in the second quarter and $158 million in the first six months of 2022 as well as from higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects. The increases in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. The comparative increase in year-to-date earnings also reflected the impact of significant losses in the first quarter of 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $51 million in the second quarter and $114 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases in earnings were primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume and in refinancing activity, and lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units at existing companies. 33  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) Corporate interest and other after-tax losses increased $41 million in the second quarter and $34 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower federal income tax credits recognized, partially offset by higher earnings from non-regulated energy services in the first six months.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group increased $528 million (7.3%) in the second quarter and $1.3 billion (9.6%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased $28 million (2.3%) in the second quarter and $102 million (4.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.4% for the first six months of 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. Operating results of this group\u2019s international businesses were also negatively impacted in 2022 by the stronger U.S. Dollar. PCC\u2019s revenues were $1.8 billion in the second quarter and $3.6 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 13.3% in the second quarter and 13.0% in the first six months compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2022 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser extent, general industrial products. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. However, further recovery likely will continue to be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, as well as from the changes in supply chain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, as it works through production quality issues. PCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased $7 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of increased revenues, substantially offset by a year-to-date reduction in pension plan income of $29 million, materials and utilities cost inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to worker shortages. PCC management continues to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for PCC\u2019s products. Growth in PCC\u2019s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to increase production levels to match the significant growth in aerospace demand, as well as resolution of the quality issues associated with the Boeing 787. Lubrizol\u2019s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 3.5% in the second quarter and 0.5% in the first six months compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Sales volumes through the first half of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol\u2019s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was due to escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 60.2% in the second quarter and were relatively unchanged in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included property losses, asset impairment charges and containment and response costs of approximately $160 million in connection with a fire at its Chemtool facility in Rockton, Illinois in June 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. in the first quarter, which resulted in lost sales and various incremental and non-recurring manufacturing and other operating costs. Earnings in 2022 included a comparative increase in insurance recoveries in connection with fires at facilities in 2021 and 2020 and were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, and higher expenses from the unplanned temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher selling prices. 35  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon\u2019s revenues were $2.8 billion in the second quarter and $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 10.3% in the second quarter and 17.5% in the first six months compared to 2021. The Transportation, Metal Services, Retail and Electrical groups generated significant revenue increases in the first six months of 2022, primarily attributable to higher volumes and average metals prices. These groups contributed approximately 70% of Marmon\u2019s aggregate revenue increase in the first six months. Marmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 5.8% in the second quarter and increased 14.6% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the second quarter of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown of its business in Russia. In the first six months of 2022, the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Electrical and Industrial Products groups contributed meaningful increases in earnings, due to a combination of higher sales volumes and margins and ongoing cost management, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group. IMC\u2019s revenues were $930 million in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 1.7% in the second quarter and 5.0% in the first six months compared to 2021. Revenues in 2022 reflected increased sales in several geographic regions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 9.6% in the second quarter and 1.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, as the revenue increases were more than offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $1.3 billion (20.4%) in the second quarter and $2.4 billion (19.9%) in the first six months of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $334 million (34.3%) in the second quarter and $708 million (40.6%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Residential home construction in the U.S. continued to be relatively strong throughout the first half of 2022. During the first half of 2022, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly compared to the previous low-rate environment. The increases in home mortgage interest rates will very likely slow demand for new home construction, which could adversely impact our businesses. We also continue to be negatively affected by persistent supply chain disruptions and significant cost increases for many raw materials and other inputs, including energy, freight and labor. Clayton Homes\u2019 revenues increased 28.1% to $3.4 billion in the second quarter and 25.0% to $6.2 billion in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $1.2 billion (30.5%) in the first six months of 2022, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. New home unit sales also increased 9.8% in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an 11.3% increase in higher factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 3.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.3% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $20.0\u00a0billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $168 million (36.9%) in the second quarter and $262 million (30.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margins and net interest income and relatively low credit losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $4.3 billion in the second quarter and $8.2 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $555 million (14.9%) in the second quarter and $1.1 billion (16.3%) in the first six months versus 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes and product mix changes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $166 million (32.1%) in the second quarter and $446 million (49.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first six months of 2022 increased 3.7 percentage points versus 2021. Year-to-date earnings in 2022 benefitted from an increase in pre-tax gains from a business divestiture and asset sales of $111 million, primarily in the first quarter. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and produced incremental production and other operating costs in the first half of 2021. 36  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products group revenues increased approximately $524 million (13.7%) in the second quarter and $1.1 billion (15.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher revenues from Forest River and lower revenues from apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River\u2019s revenues increased 34.1% in the second quarter and 37.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher average selling prices and a 5.3% year-to-date increase in unit sales. Forest River experienced exceptional sales growth in recent years, however there are signs of slowing demand which could reverse that trend. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $93 million (7.2%) in the second quarter and $137 million (5.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (15.5% in the second quarter and 10.1% in the first six months), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The declines in apparel revenues were driven by lower volumes, as retail customers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $48 million (9.6%) in the second quarter and $108 million (10.6%) in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.1 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The declines in earnings in 2022 reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Forest River\u2019s earnings increases were primarily due to the increases in sales, partly offset by higher materials costs. Apparel and footwear earnings declined about 50% in the second quarter and in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021. Our apparel businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw material, freight, labor and other operating costs. While supply chain restrictions eased somewhat in the second quarter of 2022, we expect that the operating earnings of these businesses for the remainder of 2022 will be likely lower, due to slowing demand and high costs. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months   2022   2021   2022   2021  Revenues                Service $ 4,737   $ 3,982   $ 9,260   $ 7,587  Retailing  4,880    4,995    9,472    9,348  McLane  13,262    12,295    25,777    23,917   $ 22,879   $ 21,272   $ 44,509   $ 40,852  Pre-tax earnings                Service $ 756   $ 727   $ 1,480   $ 1,317  Retailing  443    459    854    807  McLane  76    84    158    187   $ 1,275   $ 1,270   $ 2,492   $ 2,311  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues                Service  16.0 %   18.3 %   16.0 %   17.4 % Retailing  9.1 %   9.2 %   9.0 %   8.6 % McLane  0.6 %   0.7 %   0.6 %   0.8 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 37  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Service (Continued) Service group revenues increased $755 million (19.0%) in the second quarter and $1.7 billion (22.1%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 16.3% in the second quarter and 22.3% in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. During the second quarter, we saw signs that growth is beginning to decelerate, in part attributable to higher inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 22.6% in the second quarter and 23.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (29%), customer flight hours (25%) and fuel surcharges to customers due to significant increases in fuel prices, partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $29 million (4.0%) in the second quarter and $163 million (12.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 1.4 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings reflected increases from TTI and CORT and decreases from aviation services. The increases in earnings from TTI were primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage. The decreases in earnings from aviation services were attributable to the need to utilize more subcontracted aircraft due to the exceptional increase in customer flight hours, and from higher equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increases in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 65% of our combined retailing revenue in the first six months of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first six months of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues decreased $115 million (2.3%) in the second quarter and increased $124 million (1.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s revenues in the second quarter declined 1.0% and increased 3.8% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. BHA\u2019s revenues from new and used vehicle sales decreased 2.7% in the second quarter and increased 2.8% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from service and repair and finance and service contract revenues each increased versus 2021. Revenues from vehicle sales reflected higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by original equipment manufacturers, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues were relatively unchanged in the second quarter and in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, as higher average selling prices were substantially offset by lower transaction volumes. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $16 million (3.5%) in the second quarter and increased $47 million (5.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 17.2% in the second quarter and 21.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold and from operating cost control efforts. Over the remainder of 2022, BHA\u2019s comparative new vehicle gross profit margin rates may decline compared to 2021, as the current environment of elevated margins began during the second half of 2021. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $52 million (20.8%) in the second quarter and $35 million (8.0%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to declining earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in the first six months of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane\u2019s periodic revenues and earnings. 38  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues increased $967 million (7.9%) in the second quarter and $1.9 billion (7.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in the first six months of 2022 of 3.4% from the grocery business and 16.5% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $8 million (9.5%) in the second quarter and $29 million (15.5%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs, partly offset by increased gross sales margins. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. McLane\u2019s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages and higher inventory costs. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue for the remainder of 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in\u00a0millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months    2022   2021   2022   2021  Investment gains (losses)  $ (66,854 )  $ 27,173   $ (68,589 )  $ 32,384  Derivative contract gains (losses)   (65 )   221    (308 )   710  Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (66,919 )   27,394    (68,897 )   33,094  Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (13,881 )   5,986    (14,279 )   6,993  Net earnings (loss)  $ (53,038 )  $ 21,408   $ (54,618 )  $ 26,101  Effective income tax rate   21.0 %   21.4 %   20.8 %   20.9 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized losses of $66.9 billion in the second quarter and $68.5 billion in the first six months of 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $27.0 billion in the second quarter and $31.5 billion in the first six months of 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $76 million in the second quarter and taxable losses of $663 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $228 million in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts originated between 2004 and 2008. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the related equity securities markets. As of June 30, 2022, the intrinsic value of our remaining equity index put option contracts was $179 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $186 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. 39  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months   2022   2021   2022   2021  Equity method earnings $ 205   $ 141   $ 512   $ 355  Acquisition accounting expenses  (162 )   (183 )   (323 )   (363 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects  (67 )   (77 )   (137 )   (157 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes  1,061    (45 )   1,583    480  Other  80    (5 )   159    (11 )  $ 1,117   $ (169 )  $ 1,794   $ 304   After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Equity method earnings increased $157 million in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire\u2019s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire\u2019s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC\u2019s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. These gains were largely offset by losses included in investment gains/losses, pertaining to non-U.S. Dollar denominated investments held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings/loss consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at June 30, 2022 was $461.2\u00a0billion, a decrease of $45.0 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $38.3 billion in the first six months of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $54.4\u00a0billion, substantially all of which occurred in the second quarter. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30\u00a0billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $4.2 billion in the first six months of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class\u00a0A and B common stock. At June 30, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $101.3 billion, which included $76.1\u00a0billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $348.8\u00a0billion. During the first six months of 2022, we paid cash of $57.3 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $12.0 billion from sales of equity securities. Our consolidated borrowings at June 30, 2022 were $119.1 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $10.2 billion in the aggregate. 40  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition\n(Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at June 30, 2022 was $20.1 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since December\u00a031, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire\u2019s borrowings decreased $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months approximate $4.3 billion, all of which is in the first six months of 2023. Berkshire\u2019s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $22.5\u00a0billion at June 30, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $17.9 billion. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued \u20ac1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the first six months of 2022 were $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of $157 million from December 31, 2021. In June 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053. During the first six months of 2022, BNSF repaid $800 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.1 billion at June 30, 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion from December\u00a031, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053, and during the first six months of 2022, subsidiaries issued approximately $1.3 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $15.4 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $6.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $4.8 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $6.6\u00a0billion for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $125.8 billion at June 30, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of June 30, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. On March 21, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion, subject to Alleghany shareholder approval and receipt of various regulatory approvals. We currently anticipate this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. 41  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $125.8 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.6 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.4 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with that annual goodwill impairment review, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of June 30, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit\u2019s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. 42  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements\n(Continued) Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item\u00a03. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the \u201cMarket Risk Disclosures\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of June 30, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Item\u00a04. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item\u00a01. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item\u00a01A to Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 43  Item\u00a02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o\nf Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire\u2019s Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2022 follows.

(\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire\u2019s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and during 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2.\u00a0New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration contracts. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, whereby revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) are applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be recorded in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We currently estimate that as of January 1, 2021, the adoption of ASU 2018-12 will reduce our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity between $\n6\nbillion and $\n7\nbillion from the amount previously reported, primarily due to the low interest rate environment at that time.

Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors and agreed to passivity commitments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we have not applied the equity method of accounting with respect to our investment in American Express and continue to record our investment at fair value. Our equity security investments also include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\u201cOccidental\u201d) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $\n10\nbillion and warrants to purchase up to\n83.86\nmillion shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $\n59.62\nper share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at\n8\n% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in\n2029\nat a redemption price equal to\n105\n% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. Dividends on the preferred stock are payable in cash or, at Occidental\u2019s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. During the first six months of 2022, we also acquired approximately\n17\n% of the outstanding common stock of Occidental, which had a fair value of $\n9.3\nbillion as of June 30, 2022. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d). Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns\n26.6\n% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $\n71\nmillion in the second quarter and $\n277\nmillion in the first six months of 2022. We recorded an equity method loss of $\n7\nmillion in the second quarter and earnings of $\n143\nmillion in the first six months of 2021. We received dividends on the common stock of $\n260\nmillion in the first six months of both 2022 and 2021,\u00a0which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $\n12.4\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n11.7\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $\n13.0\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n13.1\nbillion at December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by\n5\n% of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment as of June 30, 2022. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required.

(\u201cIroquois\u201d). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $\n4.5\nbillion as of June 30, 2022 and $\n4.3\nbillion as of December\u00a031, 2021. We recorded equity method earnings from these entities in the first six months of $\n330\nmillion in 2022 and $\n255\nmillion in 2021. We received aggregate distributions in the first six months of $\n137\nmillion in 2022 and $\n982\nmillion in 2021, including a special distribution received from Pilot of $\n849\nmillion in the first quarter of 2021. Additional information concerning these investments follows. 9  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments\n(Continued) We own a\n50\n% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (\u201cJefferies\u201d) owning the other\n50\n% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia\u2019s operations is through commercial paper, which was $\n1.47\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and is limited to $\n1.5\nbillion. Berkadia\u2019s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) subsidiaries own\n50\n% noncontrolling interests in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas, and Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut. We own a\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than\n800\nretail locations across\n44\nU.S. states and\nsix\nCanadian provinces and is a leading supplier of fuel to third parties. The Haslam family currently owns a\n50.1\n% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining\n11.3\n% interest. We have an agreement to acquire an additional\n41.4\n% interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a\n20\n% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $\n12.0\nbillion in the first six months of 2022 and $\n8.6\nbillion in the first six months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $\n76\nmillion in the second quarter of 2022 and taxable losses of $\n663\nmillion in the first six months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $\n228\nmillion in the second quarter and $\n2.0\nbillion in the first six months of 2021. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. As of June 30, 2022, we had six open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of $\n186\nmillion and an aggregate notional value of $\n2.5\nbillion. 10  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 7.\u00a0Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions).

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims.\nA reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).   2022   2021  Balances at beginning of year:        Gross liabilities $ 86,664   $ 79,854  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  (\n2,960 )   (\n2,912 ) Net liabilities  83,704    76,942  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:        Current accident year  27,427    23,651  Prior accident years  (\n887 )   (\n1,064 ) Total  26,540    22,587  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses:        Current accident year  (\n10,085 )   (\n8,406 ) Prior accident years  (\n13,820 )   (\n11,169 ) Total  (\n23,905 )   (\n19,575 ) Foreign currency effect  (\n568 )   31  Balances at June 30:        Net liabilities  85,771    79,985  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  2,789    2,973  Gross liabilities $ 88,560   $ 82,958   Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (\u201ccurrent accident year\u201d) and events occurring in all prior years (\u201cprior accident years\u201d). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first six months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $\n887\nmillion in 2022 and $\n1.1\nbillion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were\n1.1\n% in 2022 and\n1.4\n% in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance in the first six months were reduced by $\n313\nmillion in 2022 and $\n1.1\nbillion in 2021. The reductions in each period derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims and in 2022 were partly offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years attributable to property and casualty reinsurance in the first six months decreased $\n574\nmillion in 2022 and increased $\n35\nmillion in 2021. 14  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached.\nReconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) and related deferred charges for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).   2022   2021   Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance   Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance  Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256   $ (\n10,639 )  $ 40,966   $ (\n12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:                Current year contracts  \u2014    \u2014    82    \u2014  Prior years\u2019 contracts  (\n14 )   426    (\n3 )   473  Total  (\n14 )   426    79    473  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  (\n1,008 )   \u2014    (\n808 )   \u2014  Balances at June 30 $ 37,234   $ (\n10,213 )  $ 40,237   $ (\n11,968 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 412       $ 552       In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months for prior years\u2019 contracts were $\n412\nmillion in 2022 and $\n470\nmillion in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAIG\u201d). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $\n15.2\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n15.8\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $\n4.24\nbillion at June 30, 2022 and $\n4.45\nbillion at December\u00a031, 2021. Note 15.

Notes payable and other borrowings\n(Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $\n600\nmillion of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5\n128.5\nbillion (approximately $\n1.1\nbillion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nand a weighted average interest rate of\n0.5\n%. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $\n4.5\nbillion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n3.4\n% and \u20ac\n1.25\nbillion (approximately $\n1.4\nbillion) of senior notes maturing in\n2030\nand\n2034\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n1.8\n%. In May 2022, BHFC repaid $\n775\nmillion of maturing senior notes. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (\u20ac\n8.15\nbillion, \u00a3\n1.75\nbillion and \u00a5\n914\nbillion par at June 30, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $\n1.4\nbillion in the second quarter and $\n2.1\nbillion in the first six months of 2022 as compared to pre-tax losses of $\n45\nmillion in the second quarter and pre-tax gains of $\n675\nmillion in the first six months of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $\n3.8\nbillion at June 30, 2022. Generally, Berkshire\u2019s guarantee of a subsidiary\u2019s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.6\n% senior notes due in\n2053\n. During the first six months of 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of\n3.5\n% and maturity dates ranging from\n2024\nto\n2052\n. BNSF\u2019s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2022, BNSF issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.45\n% debentures due in\n2053\n. During the first six months of 2022, BNSF repaid $\n800\nmillion of term debt. As of June 30, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $\n10.3\nbillion at June 30, 2022, which included approximately $\n8.8\nbillion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a016.

Fair value measurements\n(Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level\u00a01\n\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level\u00a02\n\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level\u00a01 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level\u00a03\n\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a017.

Class\u00a0B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to\none-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\u00a0of such rights of Class\u00a0A common stock. Each Class\u00a0B common share possesses voting rights equal to\none-ten-thousandth\n(1/10,000)\u00a0of the voting rights of a Class\u00a0A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class\u00a0A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into\n1,500\nshares of Class\u00a0B common stock. Class\u00a0B common stock is not convertible into Class\u00a0A common stock. On an equivalent Class\u00a0A common stock basis, there were\n1,468,461\nshares outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and\n1,477,429\nshares outstanding as of December\u00a031, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class\u00a0A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class\u00a0B shares outstanding. Class\u00a0B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\nof a Class\u00a0A share. Average equivalent Class\u00a0A shares outstanding represents average Class\u00a0A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500)\nof the average Class\u00a0B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class\u00a0B shares outstanding represents average Class\u00a0B shares outstanding plus\n1,500\ntimes the average Class\u00a0A shares outstanding. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\nThe program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $\n30\nbillion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class\u00a0A or Class\u00a0B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note\u00a018. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were\n21.8\n% in the second quarter and\n22.4\n% in the first six months of 2022 compared to\n20.4\n% in the second quarter and\n19.9\n% in the first six months of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a019.

Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger dated as of\nMarch 20, 2022\n, whereby Berkshire will acquire all of Alleghany\u2019s outstanding common stock for cash of approximately $\n11.6\nbillion. The Alleghany shareholders voted to approve and adopt the agreement and plan of merger on June 9, 2022. The acquisition of Alleghany is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to the receipt of various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Alleghany owns property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Greg Abel, Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $\n870\nmillion. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholders agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE\u2019s non-controlling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $\n362\nmillion to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest. 20  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note\u00a022. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.\nThe following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 and 2021 (in millions).

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. In varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and during 2022 included periodic temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have developed in 2022. While direct losses to-date have not been material to consolidated results, these events had indirect impacts by contributing to the disruptions of global supply chains, resulting in cost increases for goods and services in parts of the world where we operate. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings increased $205 million (54.5%) in the second quarter and decreased $512 million (44.9%) in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. In each period, underwriting earnings from GEICO declined, primarily attributable to increases in claims frequencies and severities and lower reductions of ultimate claim estimates for prior years\u2019 losses. Underwriting earnings in 2022 from reinsurance activities increased compared to 2021, reflecting foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities on insurance contracts of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and improved life results. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased 56.4% in the second quarter and 26.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 9.8% in the second quarter and 9.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. These increases reflected higher revenue per car/unit, partly offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 3.5% in the second quarter and 5.1% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected higher earnings from tax equity investments and from the natural gas pipeline and Northern Powergrid businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 8.2% in the second quarter and 11.6% in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. Results were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in the first six months of 2022, we continue to experience the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or in evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange gains related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2022, compared to after-tax losses of $45 million and after-tax gains of $480 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively. 24  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100\u00a0million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first six months included floods in Australia and South Africa in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $126 billion as of June 30, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While the effects of the pandemic on underwriting results in the first six months of 2022 were insignificant, results in future periods may be affected by legal and regulatory actions pertaining to insurance coverage, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO\u2019s pre-tax underwriting loss in the first half of 2022 reflected increased claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in automobile markets, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to increased claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher than general inflation rates. Premiums written increased $186 million (2.0%) in the second quarter and $445 million (2.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in policies in-force. Premiums earned increased $261 million (2.7%) in the second quarter and $892 million (4.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Premiums earned in the first six months of 2021 included a reduction of approximately $460 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.5 billion (19.5%) in the second quarter and $3.6 billion (25.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO\u2019s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 92.8% in the second quarter and 91.2% in the first six months of 2022, increases of 13.0 percentage points and 15.0 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, which reflected increases in claims frequencies and severities for the current year and lower reductions of loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (four to five percent range), collision (ten to eleven percent range), bodily injury (six to seven percent range) and personal injury (seven to eight percent range). Average claims severities in the first six months of 2022 were higher for property damage coverage (eleven to twelve percent range), collision coverage (nineteen to twenty percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events of $207 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $846 million in the first six months of 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases for bodily and personal injury coverages, partially offset by increases for collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Underwriting expenses decreased $114 million (8.7%) in the second quarter and $363 million (13.2%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower advertising costs in both periods and lower employee-related costs in the first six months. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 12.2% in the second quarter and first six months of 2022, decreases of 1.4 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, attributable to both the decreases in expenses as well as the increases in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary\u2019s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d), National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d).

The increases were primarily on property and casualty coverages in the U.S. across several markets. 26  Item\n2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary\u2019s loss ratio was 67.7% in the second quarter and 70.2% in the first six months of 2022, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points in the second quarter and relatively unchanged in the first six months compared to 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses from significant catastrophe events were $75 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $156 million in 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events of $106 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $253 million in 2021. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. We could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses increased $194 million (30.6%) in the second quarter and $347 million (28.1%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The expense ratio increased 2.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.8 percentage points in the first six months compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity business due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such business, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG\u2019s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written increased $733 million (21.4%) in the second quarter and $736 million (9.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting net increases from new property business and rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $229 million (10.0%) in the second quarter and $329 million (7.0%) in the first six months, while the loss ratio declined 10.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 6.6 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events were $443 million in the second quarter and $758 million in the first six months of 2022, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $437 million in the second quarter and $574 million in the first six months. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were $108 million in the second quarter and $418 million in the first six months of 2021. Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events were relatively insignificant in the second quarter and first six months of 2021. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 11.6 percentage points in the second quarter and 7.8 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $308 million in the second quarter and $389 million in the first six months of 2022, primarily related to a third quarter 2021 intercompany reinsurance agreement in which a non-U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary ceded non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities to a U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary. Under U.S. GAAP, the effects of exchange rate changes from the remeasurement of liabilities assumed by the U.S. subsidiary are reflected in earnings as its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The net foreign currency exchange rate effects from translating the financial statements of the non-U.S. subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar are included in other comprehensive income.

Life and health benefits declined $271 million (21.9%) in the second quarter and $471 million (18.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to lower mortality. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant, pandemic-related increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains were $157 million in the first six months of 2022, substantially all of which was in the second quarter. Foreign currency exchange gains/losses were insignificant in the corresponding 2021 periods. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $204 million in the second quarter and $399 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $220 million in the second quarter and $463 million in the first six months of 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2022 to $37.2 billion at June 30, 2022, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $426 million in the first six months of 2022 to $10.2 billion at June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. 28  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $45 million (36.6%) in the second quarter and $70 million (26.2%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $116 million in the second quarter and $160 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to losses of $10 million in the second quarter and $20 million in the first six months of 2021. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $143 million in the second quarter and $290 million in the first six months of 2022 and $134 million in the second quarter and $260 million in the first six months of 2021. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.4 billion at June 30, 2022 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $5 million in the second quarter and gains of $51 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to pre-tax gains of $4 million in the second quarter and $125 million in the first six months of 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and changes in securities markets which were unfavorable in 2022 and favorable in 2021. Insurance\u2014Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).  Second Quarter   First Six Months   Percentage Change   2022   2021   2022   2021   Second Quarter   First Six Months  Dividend income $ 2,055   $ 1,298   $ 3,252   $ 2,551    58.3 %   27.5 % Interest and other investment income  228    158    392    317    44.3    23.7  Pre-tax net investment income  2,283    1,456    3,644    2,868    56.8    27.1  Income taxes and noncontrolling interests  377    237    568    441          Net investment income $ 1,906   $ 1,219   $ 3,076   $ 2,427          Effective income tax rate  16.5 %   16.3 %   15.6 %   15.4 %         Dividend income increased 58.3% in the second quarter and 27.5% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during the first six months of 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $13 million in the second quarter and $29 million in the first six months of 2022 and $37 million in the second quarter and $75 million in the first six months of 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased 44.3% in the second quarter and 23.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, interest rates began to increase during 2022. The effects of such increases are expected to be reflected in our earnings as maturing investments are replaced by new investments. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 29  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Investment Income\n(Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2022 and 2021, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative.

Railroad operating revenues reflected lower volumes of 5.6% in the second quarter and 4.5% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased 8.7% in the second quarter and 8.9% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.5 billion in the second quarter and $4.5 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 17.6% and 14.1%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 7.4% in the second quarter and 7.9% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain disruptions, partially offset by modest increases in domestic intermodal and automotive volumes. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 7.8% and 6.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 3.9% in the second quarter and 1.6% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to a decrease in petroleum shipments related to lower demand for crude by rail and network challenges, with the decrease in the first six months partially offset by increased volumes in other product categories. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $2.7 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 9.1% and 6.4%, respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by decreased volumes of 3.2% in the second quarter and 3.6% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of renewable diesel and oil feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 30.2% and 29.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased 2.9% in the second quarter primarily due to network challenges, while volumes increased 5.0% in the first six months of 2022 due to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $4.1 billion in the second quarter and $7.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $687 million (20.3%) and $1.1 billion (16.3%), respectively, compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 2.8 percentage points to 63.2% in the second quarter and 1.9 percentage points to 63.9% in the first six months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $68 million (5.9%) in the second quarter and $128 million (5.5%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $583 million (84.1%) in the second quarter and $894 million (71.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. 31  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE\u2019s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings decreased $143 million in the second quarter and $182 million in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses and lower income tax benefits mainly from lower production tax credits recognized, partially offset by slight increases in utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). The increases in operating expenses reflected higher costs associated with wildfires, higher general and plant maintenance costs and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp\u2019s utility margin was $863 million in the second quarter and $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $6 million and $20 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2021. The increases reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing, partially offset by lower operating revenue from decreases in retail customer volumes and higher thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes decreased 3.3% in the second quarter and 0.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather and lower customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the second quarter and increased $90 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase for the first six months reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms as well as incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC\u2019s electric utility margin was $551 million in the second quarter and $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 14% and 18%, respectively, versus 2021. The increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from increased retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by higher purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.3% in the second quarter and 4.4% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the second quarter and $12 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher comparative accruals for earnings sharing and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy\u2019s electric utility margin was $404 million in the second quarter and $710 million in the first six months of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.4% in the second quarter and 2.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and higher customer usage, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid\u2019s after-tax earnings increased $96 million in the second quarter and $103 million in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021, reflecting the impact on deferred income taxes in 2021 from an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2022. Earnings in each period of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Natural gas pipelines\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $88 million in the second quarter and $14 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher earnings at BHE GT&S, largely from favorable state income tax adjustments, the impacts of an agreement in principle related to a general rate case and lower operating expenses. The year-to-date increase was offset by higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $81 million in the second quarter and $192 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings were primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $40 million in the second quarter and $158 million in the first six months of 2022 as well as from higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects. The increases in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. The comparative increase in year-to-date earnings also reflected the impact of significant losses in the first quarter of 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $51 million in the second quarter and $114 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases in earnings were primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume and in refinancing activity, and lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units at existing companies. 33  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) Corporate interest and other after-tax losses increased $41 million in the second quarter and $34 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower federal income tax credits recognized, partially offset by higher earnings from non-regulated energy services in the first six months.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group increased $528 million (7.3%) in the second quarter and $1.3 billion (9.6%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased $28 million (2.3%) in the second quarter and $102 million (4.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.4% for the first six months of 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. Operating results of this group\u2019s international businesses were also negatively impacted in 2022 by the stronger U.S. Dollar. PCC\u2019s revenues were $1.8 billion in the second quarter and $3.6 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 13.3% in the second quarter and 13.0% in the first six months compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2022 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser extent, general industrial products. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. However, further recovery likely will continue to be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, as well as from the changes in supply chain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, as it works through production quality issues. PCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased $7 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of increased revenues, substantially offset by a year-to-date reduction in pension plan income of $29 million, materials and utilities cost inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to worker shortages. PCC management continues to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for PCC\u2019s products. Growth in PCC\u2019s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to increase production levels to match the significant growth in aerospace demand, as well as resolution of the quality issues associated with the Boeing 787. Lubrizol\u2019s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 3.5% in the second quarter and 0.5% in the first six months compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Sales volumes through the first half of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol\u2019s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was due to escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 60.2% in the second quarter and were relatively unchanged in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included property losses, asset impairment charges and containment and response costs of approximately $160 million in connection with a fire at its Chemtool facility in Rockton, Illinois in June 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. in the first quarter, which resulted in lost sales and various incremental and non-recurring manufacturing and other operating costs. Earnings in 2022 included a comparative increase in insurance recoveries in connection with fires at facilities in 2021 and 2020 and were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, and higher expenses from the unplanned temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher selling prices. 35  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon\u2019s revenues were $2.8 billion in the second quarter and $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 10.3% in the second quarter and 17.5% in the first six months compared to 2021. The Transportation, Metal Services, Retail and Electrical groups generated significant revenue increases in the first six months of 2022, primarily attributable to higher volumes and average metals prices. These groups contributed approximately 70% of Marmon\u2019s aggregate revenue increase in the first six months. Marmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 5.8% in the second quarter and increased 14.6% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the second quarter of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown of its business in Russia. In the first six months of 2022, the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Electrical and Industrial Products groups contributed meaningful increases in earnings, due to a combination of higher sales volumes and margins and ongoing cost management, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group. IMC\u2019s revenues were $930 million in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 1.7% in the second quarter and 5.0% in the first six months compared to 2021. Revenues in 2022 reflected increased sales in several geographic regions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 9.6% in the second quarter and 1.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, as the revenue increases were more than offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $1.3 billion (20.4%) in the second quarter and $2.4 billion (19.9%) in the first six months of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $334 million (34.3%) in the second quarter and $708 million (40.6%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Residential home construction in the U.S. continued to be relatively strong throughout the first half of 2022. During the first half of 2022, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly compared to the previous low-rate environment. The increases in home mortgage interest rates will very likely slow demand for new home construction, which could adversely impact our businesses. We also continue to be negatively affected by persistent supply chain disruptions and significant cost increases for many raw materials and other inputs, including energy, freight and labor. Clayton Homes\u2019 revenues increased 28.1% to $3.4 billion in the second quarter and 25.0% to $6.2 billion in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $1.2 billion (30.5%) in the first six months of 2022, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. New home unit sales also increased 9.8% in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an 11.3% increase in higher factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 3.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.3% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $20.0\u00a0billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $168 million (36.9%) in the second quarter and $262 million (30.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margins and net interest income and relatively low credit losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $4.3 billion in the second quarter and $8.2 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $555 million (14.9%) in the second quarter and $1.1 billion (16.3%) in the first six months versus 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes and product mix changes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $166 million (32.1%) in the second quarter and $446 million (49.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first six months of 2022 increased 3.7 percentage points versus 2021. Year-to-date earnings in 2022 benefitted from an increase in pre-tax gains from a business divestiture and asset sales of $111 million, primarily in the first quarter. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and produced incremental production and other operating costs in the first half of 2021. 36  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products group revenues increased approximately $524 million (13.7%) in the second quarter and $1.1 billion (15.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher revenues from Forest River and lower revenues from apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River\u2019s revenues increased 34.1% in the second quarter and 37.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher average selling prices and a 5.3% year-to-date increase in unit sales. Forest River experienced exceptional sales growth in recent years, however there are signs of slowing demand which could reverse that trend. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $93 million (7.2%) in the second quarter and $137 million (5.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (15.5% in the second quarter and 10.1% in the first six months), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The declines in apparel revenues were driven by lower volumes, as retail customers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $48 million (9.6%) in the second quarter and $108 million (10.6%) in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.1 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The declines in earnings in 2022 reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Forest River\u2019s earnings increases were primarily due to the increases in sales, partly offset by higher materials costs. Apparel and footwear earnings declined about 50% in the second quarter and in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021. Our apparel businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw material, freight, labor and other operating costs. While supply chain restrictions eased somewhat in the second quarter of 2022, we expect that the operating earnings of these businesses for the remainder of 2022 will be likely lower, due to slowing demand and high costs. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months   2022   2021   2022   2021  Revenues                Service $ 4,737   $ 3,982   $ 9,260   $ 7,587  Retailing  4,880    4,995    9,472    9,348  McLane  13,262    12,295    25,777    23,917   $ 22,879   $ 21,272   $ 44,509   $ 40,852  Pre-tax earnings                Service $ 756   $ 727   $ 1,480   $ 1,317  Retailing  443    459    854    807  McLane  76    84    158    187   $ 1,275   $ 1,270   $ 2,492   $ 2,311  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues                Service  16.0 %   18.3 %   16.0 %   17.4 % Retailing  9.1 %   9.2 %   9.0 %   8.6 % McLane  0.6 %   0.7 %   0.6 %   0.8 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 37  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Service (Continued) Service group revenues increased $755 million (19.0%) in the second quarter and $1.7 billion (22.1%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 16.3% in the second quarter and 22.3% in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. During the second quarter, we saw signs that growth is beginning to decelerate, in part attributable to higher inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 22.6% in the second quarter and 23.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (29%), customer flight hours (25%) and fuel surcharges to customers due to significant increases in fuel prices, partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $29 million (4.0%) in the second quarter and $163 million (12.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 1.4 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings reflected increases from TTI and CORT and decreases from aviation services. The increases in earnings from TTI were primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage. The decreases in earnings from aviation services were attributable to the need to utilize more subcontracted aircraft due to the exceptional increase in customer flight hours, and from higher equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increases in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 65% of our combined retailing revenue in the first six months of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first six months of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues decreased $115 million (2.3%) in the second quarter and increased $124 million (1.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s revenues in the second quarter declined 1.0% and increased 3.8% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. BHA\u2019s revenues from new and used vehicle sales decreased 2.7% in the second quarter and increased 2.8% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from service and repair and finance and service contract revenues each increased versus 2021. Revenues from vehicle sales reflected higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by original equipment manufacturers, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues were relatively unchanged in the second quarter and in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, as higher average selling prices were substantially offset by lower transaction volumes. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $16 million (3.5%) in the second quarter and increased $47 million (5.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 17.2% in the second quarter and 21.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold and from operating cost control efforts. Over the remainder of 2022, BHA\u2019s comparative new vehicle gross profit margin rates may decline compared to 2021, as the current environment of elevated margins began during the second half of 2021. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $52 million (20.8%) in the second quarter and $35 million (8.0%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to declining earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in the first six months of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane\u2019s periodic revenues and earnings. 38  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues increased $967 million (7.9%) in the second quarter and $1.9 billion (7.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in the first six months of 2022 of 3.4% from the grocery business and 16.5% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $8 million (9.5%) in the second quarter and $29 million (15.5%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs, partly offset by increased gross sales margins. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. McLane\u2019s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages and higher inventory costs. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue for the remainder of 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in\u00a0millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months    2022   2021   2022   2021  Investment gains (losses)  $ (66,854 )  $ 27,173   $ (68,589 )  $ 32,384  Derivative contract gains (losses)   (65 )   221    (308 )   710  Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (66,919 )   27,394    (68,897 )   33,094  Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (13,881 )   5,986    (14,279 )   6,993  Net earnings (loss)  $ (53,038 )  $ 21,408   $ (54,618 )  $ 26,101  Effective income tax rate   21.0 %   21.4 %   20.8 %   20.9 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized losses of $66.9 billion in the second quarter and $68.5 billion in the first six months of 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $27.0 billion in the second quarter and $31.5 billion in the first six months of 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $76 million in the second quarter and taxable losses of $663 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $228 million in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts originated between 2004 and 2008. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the related equity securities markets. As of June 30, 2022, the intrinsic value of our remaining equity index put option contracts was $179 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $186 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. 39  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months   2022   2021   2022   2021  Equity method earnings $ 205   $ 141   $ 512   $ 355  Acquisition accounting expenses  (162 )   (183 )   (323 )   (363 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects  (67 )   (77 )   (137 )   (157 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes  1,061    (45 )   1,583    480  Other  80    (5 )   159    (11 )  $ 1,117   $ (169 )  $ 1,794   $ 304   After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Equity method earnings increased $157 million in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire\u2019s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire\u2019s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC\u2019s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. These gains were largely offset by losses included in investment gains/losses, pertaining to non-U.S. Dollar denominated investments held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings/loss consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at June 30, 2022 was $461.2\u00a0billion, a decrease of $45.0 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $38.3 billion in the first six months of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $54.4\u00a0billion, substantially all of which occurred in the second quarter. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30\u00a0billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $4.2 billion in the first six months of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class\u00a0A and B common stock. At June 30, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $101.3 billion, which included $76.1\u00a0billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $348.8\u00a0billion. During the first six months of 2022, we paid cash of $57.3 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $12.0 billion from sales of equity securities. Our consolidated borrowings at June 30, 2022 were $119.1 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $10.2 billion in the aggregate. 40  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition\n(Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at June 30, 2022 was $20.1 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since December\u00a031, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire\u2019s borrowings decreased $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months approximate $4.3 billion, all of which is in the first six months of 2023. Berkshire\u2019s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $22.5\u00a0billion at June 30, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $17.9 billion. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued \u20ac1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the first six months of 2022 were $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of $157 million from December 31, 2021. In June 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053. During the first six months of 2022, BNSF repaid $800 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.1 billion at June 30, 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion from December\u00a031, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053, and during the first six months of 2022, subsidiaries issued approximately $1.3 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $15.4 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $6.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $4.8 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $6.6\u00a0billion for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $125.8 billion at June 30, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of June 30, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. On March 21, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion, subject to Alleghany shareholder approval and receipt of various regulatory approvals. We currently anticipate this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. 41  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $125.8 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.6 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.4 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with that annual goodwill impairment review, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of June 30, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit\u2019s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. 42  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements\n(Continued) Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item\u00a03. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the \u201cMarket Risk Disclosures\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of June 30, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Item\u00a04. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item\u00a01. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item\u00a01A to Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 43  Item\u00a02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o\nf Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire\u2019s Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2022 follows.

Consolidated Financial Statements 7  BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2022 Note 1. General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire\u2019s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. Such actions in 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world. In addition, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and have persisted in 2022. The development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. In the U.S. and elsewhere, governments are implementing actions intended to slow price inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration contracts. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, whereby revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) are applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured, with the cumulative effect from discount rate changes (based on changes in prevailing interest rates) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment and continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption beginning as of the transition date, we believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will initially have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We preliminarily estimate the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2018-12 will reduce our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity from the amount previously reported by approximately $\n6.5\nbillion as of January 1, 2021, with that reduction declining to approximately $\n4.7\nbillion as of December 31, 2021. While we have not determined the effect of adopting ASU 2018-12 as of September 30, 2022, we currently expect the cumulative reduction to our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity has declined significantly since December 31, 2021, based on the interest rate increases in 2022. 8  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 3.

Investments in equity securities\n(Continued) As of September 30, 2022, we owned\n151.6\nmillion shares of American Express Company (\u201cAmerican Express\u201d) common stock representing\n20.3\n% of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors and we have agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we have not applied the equity method of accounting to our investment in American Express and continue to record our investment at fair value. During the first six months of 2022, we acquired approximately\n17\n% of the outstanding common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\u201cOccidental\u201d) and in the third quarter of 2022, we acquired additional shares such that our aggregate voting interest exceeded\n20\n% on August 4, 2022. We adopted the equity method with respect to our investment in Occidental common stock as of that date and included this investment in equity method investments at September 30, 2022. See Note 5. We continue to report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. Our investment in Occidental preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation value of $\n10\nbillion and our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to\n83.86\nmillion shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $\n59.62\nper share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at\n8\n% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in\n2029\nat a redemption price equal to\n105\n% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d) and, as of August 4, 2022, Occidental. We own\n26.5\n% of Kraft Heinz common stock and we own\n20.9\n% of Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental common stock warrants. See Note 4. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, including oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental\u2019s midstream businesses purchase, market, gather, process, transport and store various oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide and other products. We anticipate Occidental\u2019s financial information will not be available in time for concurrent reporting in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we will report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Our earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 will include our equity method share of Occidental's third quarter earnings. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded.\nThe fair values and carrying values of these two investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions). We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment as of September 30, 2022. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required.

(\u201cIroquois\u201d). Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a\n50\n% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (\u201cJefferies\u201d) owning the other\n50\n% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia\u2019s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $\n1.5\nbillion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\u201cBHE\u201d) subsidiaries own\n50\n% noncontrolling interests in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas, and Iroquois, an owner and operator of natural gas pipeline assets in New York and Connecticut. We own a\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than\n800\nretail locations across\n44\nU.S. states and\nsix\nCanadian provinces and is a leading supplier of fuel to third parties. We have an agreement to acquire an additional\n41.4\n% interest in Pilot in the first quarter of 2023 for a value to be determined, based upon Pilot's adjusted earnings in 2022 and its net debt at December 31, 2022. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot at that time. 11  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 6.

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $\n17.3\nbillion in the first nine months of 2022 and $\n12.0\nbillion in the first nine months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $\n3\nmillion in the third quarter and taxable losses of $\n660\nmillion in the first nine months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $\n941\nmillion in the third quarter and $\n2.9\nbillion in the first nine months of 2021. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts. As of September 30, 2022, we had four open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of less than $\n1\nmillion and an aggregate notional value of $\n1.6\nbillion. 12  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 7.

The Seritage loan is pursuant to a $\n2.0\nbillion term loan facility and the outstanding loan is secured by mortgages on its real estate properties. The Seritage loan agreement allows optional loan prepayments without penalty and further provides the option to extend the maturity of the loan to\nJuly 31, 2025\n, if the outstanding principal has been reduced to $\n800\nmillion by the original expiration date of\nJuly 31, 2023\n.

Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims.\nA reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).   2022   2021  Balances at beginning of year:      Gross liabilities $ 86,664   $ 79,854  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  (\n2,960 )   (\n2,912 ) Net liabilities  83,704    76,942  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current accident year  44,472    38,447  Prior accident years  (\n2,141 )   (\n2,151 ) Total  42,331    36,296  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current accident year  (\n17,543 )   (\n15,277 ) Prior accident years  (\n18,564 )   (\n15,076 ) Total  (\n36,107 )   (\n30,353 ) Foreign currency effect  (\n1,044 )   (\n119 ) Balances at September 30:      Net liabilities  88,884    82,766  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  2,758    2,988  Gross liabilities $ 91,642   $ 85,754   Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (\u201ccurrent accident year\u201d) and events occurring in all prior years (\u201cprior accident years\u201d). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 included approximately $\n4.0\nbillion and $\n2.7\nbillion, respectively, from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $\n100\nmillion per event). Significant catastrophe events in the first nine months included Hurricane Ian ($\n3.4\nbillion) and floods in Australia and South Africa in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri, Hurricane Ida ($\n1.5\nbillion) and floods in Europe in 2021. In the first nine months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $\n2.1\nbillion in 2022 and $\n2.2\nbillion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were\n2.6\n% in 2022 and\n2.8\n% in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance in the first nine months were reduced by $\n734\nmillion in 2022 and $\n1.6\nbillion in 2021. The reductions in each period derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years attributable to property and casualty reinsurance in the first nine months decreased $\n1.4\nbillion in 2022 and $\n564\nmillion in 2021. 16  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached.\nReconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) and related deferred charges for each of the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).   2022   2021   Unpaid losses\nand loss\nadjustment\nexpenses   Deferred\ncharges - retroactive reinsurance   Unpaid losses\nand loss\nadjustment\nexpenses   Deferred\ncharges - retroactive reinsurance  Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256   $ (\n10,639 )  $ 40,966   $ (\n12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:            Current year contracts  \u2014    \u2014    82    \u2014  Prior years\u2019 contracts  (\n23 )   649    (\n9 )   709  Total  (\n23 )   649    73    709  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  (\n1,567 )   \u2014    (\n1,318 )   \u2014  Balances at September 30 $ 36,666   $ (\n9,990 )  $ 39,721   $ (\n11,732 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 626      $ 782      In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months for prior years\u2019 contracts were $\n626\nmillion in 2022 and $\n700\nmillion in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAIG\u201d). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $\n14.8\nbillion at September 30, 2022 and $\n15.8\nbillion at December 31, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $\n4.14\nbillion at September 30, 2022 and $\n4.45\nbillion at December 31, 2021. Note 15.

Notes payable and other borrowings\n(Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $\n600\nmillion of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5\n128.5\nbillion (approximately $\n1.1\nbillion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nand a weighted average interest rate of\n0.5\n%. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $\n4.5\nbillion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from\n2027\nto\n2052\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n3.4\n% and \u20ac\n1.25\nbillion (approximately $\n1.4\nbillion) of senior notes maturing in\n2030\nand\n2034\nwith a weighted average interest rate of\n1.8\n%. In May 2022, BHFC repaid $\n775\nmillion of maturing senior notes. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (\u20ac\n8.15\nbillion, \u00a3\n1.75\nbillion and \u00a5\n914\nbillion par at September 30, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $\n1.2\nbillion in the third quarter and $\n3.3\nbillion in the first nine months of 2022 as compared to $\n264\nmillion in the third quarter and $\n939\nmillion in the first nine months of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $\n3.7\nbillion at September 30, 2022. Generally, Berkshire\u2019s guarantee of a subsidiary\u2019s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.6\n% senior notes due in\n2053\n. During the first nine months of 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of variable and fixed rate term debt with a weighted average interest rate of\n3.9\n% as of September 30 and maturity dates ranging from\n2024\nto\n2052\n. BNSF\u2019s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2022, BNSF issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.45\n% debentures due in\n2053\n. During the first nine months of 2022, BNSF repaid $\n900\nmillion of term debt. As of September 30, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $\n10.7\nbillion at September 30, 2022, which included approximately $\n9.2\nbillion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 18  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 16.

Fair value measurements\n(Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1\n\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2\n\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3\n\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 20  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 17.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to\none-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to\none-ten-thousandth\n(1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into\n1,500\nshares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were\n1,466,045\nshares outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and\n1,477,429\nshares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (\n1/1,500\n) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (\n1/1,500\n) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus\n1,500\ntimes the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\nThe program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $\n30\nbillion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were\n37.1\n% in the third quarter and\n23.5\n% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to\n14.7\n% in the third quarter and\n18.8\n% in the first nine months of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 21  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On\nMarch 20, 2022\n, Berkshire entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) to acquire all of Alleghany\u2019s outstanding common stock for cash consideration of approximately $\n11.6\nbillion. Following the receipt of Alleghany shareholder approval on June 9, 2022 and all required regulatory approvals, the acquisition was completed on\nOctober 19, 2022\n. The consideration paid was funded by existing cash balances. Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. Given the proximity of the Alleghany acquisition date to the date these interim Consolidated Financial Statements were issued, it was impracticable to provide an initial estimate of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and residual goodwill or proforma information. We expect to provide disclosures of preliminary values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date as well as proforma information, if material, in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ending December 31, 2022. Alleghany\u2019s most recently available historical consolidated financial statements are as of September 30, 2022. As of that date, Alleghany\u2019s total assets and liabilities were $\n31.2\nbillion and $\n23.4\nbillion, respectively. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Greg Abel, Berkshire\u2019s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $\n870\nmillion. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholders agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE\u2019s non-controlling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $\n362\nmillion to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest. 22  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.\nThe following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 and 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses.

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. In varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our operating businesses. In addition, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and have persisted in 2022. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have developed in 2022. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings decreased $178 million in the third quarter and $690 million in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. After-tax incurred losses attributable to significant catastrophe occurrences in the third quarter were approximately $2.7 billion from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $1.7 billion from Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in 2021. Underwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims frequencies and severities, and favorably impacted by higher foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries and improved life and health reinsurance results. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $247 million in the third quarter and $896 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings of our railroad, BNSF, declined 6.2% in the third quarter and increased 4.0% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The comparative changes in earnings in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 5.9% in the third quarter and 5.5% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected higher earnings from tax equity investments and from the natural gas pipeline and Northern Powergrid businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 20.0% in the third quarter and 14.3% in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. Results were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the third quarter at certain of our businesses. We continue to experience the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or in evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange gains related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $858 million in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022, compared to $196 million and $676 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. 26  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2022 included Hurricane Ian in the third quarter and floods in Australia and South Africa during the first six months, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter and Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. We recorded estimated pre-tax losses of $3.4 billion from Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 and $2.2 billion from Hurricane Ida and European floods in the third quarter of 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $128 billion as of September 30, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While pandemic-related losses in the first nine months of 2022 were insignificant, results in future periods may be affected by legal and regulatory actions pertaining to insurance coverage, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (\"Alleghany\"), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. These businesses will be incorporated into our reinsurance and primary insurance results beginning as of the acquisition date. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO\u2019s pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected increased claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and have continued through 2022. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to elevated claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher. Premiums written were relatively unchanged in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, which were substantially offset by a decrease in policies-in-force. Voluntary auto policies-in-force declined 4.6% over the first nine months of 2022 while average premiums per voluntary auto policy increased by approximately 5.4%. Premiums earned increased $204 million (2.1%) in the third quarter and $1.1 billion (3.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Premiums earned in the first nine months of 2021 included a reduction of approximately $475 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.0 billion (12.1%) in the third quarter and $4.6 billion (20.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO\u2019s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 97.0% in the third quarter and 93.1% in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 8.6 percentage points and 12.7 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and severities, as well as lower reductions of loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events and an increase in significant catastrophe losses. Claims frequencies in the first nine months of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent range), bodily injury and personal injury (four to five percent range) and collision (six to seven percent range). Average claims severities in the first nine months of 2022 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (seventeen to nineteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events of $386 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $1.2 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases in all major coverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the third quarter were approximately $600 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $400 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021. Underwriting expenses decreased $355 million (25.2%) in the third quarter and $718 million (17.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant reductions in advertising costs in both periods and lower employee-related costs in the first nine months. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 10.7% in the third quarter and 11.8% in the first nine months of 2022, decreases of 3.9 percentage points and 3.0 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, attributable to both the decreases in expenses as well as the increases in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary\u2019s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d), National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d).

The increases were across a variety of property and casualty coverages and across several markets. 28  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary\u2019s loss ratio was 81.1% in the third quarter and 74.0% in the first nine months of 2022, an increase of 5.5 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.8 percentage points in the first nine months compared to 2021. Losses from catastrophe events in 2022 were approximately $660 million in the third quarter (Hurricane Ian) and $740 million in the first nine months. Losses from catastrophe events in 2021 were approximately $260 million in the third quarter (largely Hurricane Ida) and $420 million in the first nine months. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events in the first nine months of $348 million in 2022 and $420 million in 2021. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors. Underwriting expenses increased $194 million (26.0%) in the third quarter and $541 million (27.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The expense ratio increased 1.8 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development programs and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity business due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such business, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG\u2019s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written increased $459 million (11.2%) in the third quarter and $1.2 billion (10.0%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to net increases in new property business and higher rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $465 million (15.6%) in the third quarter and $136 million (1.8%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred from catastrophe events were $1.9 billion in the third quarter (primarily Hurricane Ian) and $2.6 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years were $833 million in the third quarter and $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and were $599 million in the third quarter and $564 million in the first nine months of 2021. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 11.3 percentage points in the third quarter and 9.1 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $315 million in the third quarter and $704 million in the first nine months of 2022, primarily related to a third quarter 2021 intercompany reinsurance agreement in which a non-U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary ceded non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities to a U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary. The foreign currency exchange gains in the third quarter of 2021 were not significant. Under U.S. GAAP, the effects of exchange rate changes from the remeasurement of liabilities assumed by the U.S. subsidiary are reflected in earnings as its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The net foreign currency exchange rate effects from translating the financial statements of the non-U.S. subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar are included in other comprehensive income. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).  Third Quarter   First Nine Months   2022   2021   2022   2021   Amount   %   Amount   %   Amount   %   Amount   %  Premiums written $ 1,251      $ 1,332      $ 3,743      $ 3,929     Premiums earned $ 1,309    100.0   $ 1,328    100.0   $ 3,822    100.0   $ 3,932    100.0  Life and health insurance benefits  1,013    77.4    1,247    93.9    3,028    79.2    3,733    94.9  Underwriting expenses  229    17.5    262    19.7    664    17.4    721    18.4  Total benefits and expenses  1,242    94.9    1,509    113.6    3,692    96.6    4,454    113.3  Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 67      $ (181 )     $ 130      $ (522 )    Life/health premiums written decreased $81 million (6.1%) in the third quarter and $186 million (4.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits declined $234 million (18.8%) in the third quarter and $705 million (18.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to relatively high pandemic-related mortality claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains were $130 million in the third quarter and $287 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $70 million in the first nine months of 2021, substantially all of which was in the third quarter. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $213 million in the third quarter and $612 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $227 million in the third quarter and $690 million in the first nine months of 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2022 to $36.7 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $649 million in the first nine months of 2022 to $10.0 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. 30  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned were relatively unchanged in the third quarter and increased 15.5% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses, deriving from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accrual on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $119 million in the third quarter and $279 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $45 million in the third quarter and $25 million in the first nine months of 2021. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $268 million in the third quarter and $558 million in the first nine months of 2022 and $139 million in the third quarter and $399 million in the first nine months of 2021. Pre-tax losses in the third quarter of 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to an agreement to terminate an existing reinsurance contract, in which the settlement payable exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.2 billion at September 30, 2022, which included $3.9 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-12 in 2023, the discount rates will be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates which could have a significant effect on our recorded annuity liabilities. The periodic effect from discount rate changes will be largely reflected in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $32 million in the third quarter and $83 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to pre-tax losses of $28 million in the third quarter and gains of $97 million in the first nine months of 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate increases and changes in securities markets which were unfavorable in 2022 and favorable in 2021. Underwriting results in the third quarter of 2021 included losses from lower underlying lapse rate assumptions. Insurance\u2014Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).

The increases in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $8 million in the third quarter and $37 million in the first nine months of 2022 and $26 million in the third quarter and $101 million in the first nine months of 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased $256 million (181.6%) in the third quarter and $331 million (72.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, interest rates increased significantly over the first nine months of 2022. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 31  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Investment Income\n(Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $150 billion at September 30, 2022 and $147 billion at December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $358 million in the first nine months of 2022 and, consequently, the average cost of float for that period was 0.24%. In October 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany, which operates insurance and reinsurance businesses. Estimated float of Alleghany\u2019s businesses approximated $13.5 billion based on its historical balance sheet at September 30, 2022.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad\n(Continued) The following table summarizes BNSF\u2019s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands).    Cars/Units   Percentage Change    Third Quarter   First Nine Months   Third  First Nine    2022   2021   2022   2021   Quarter  Months  Consumer products   1,323    1,425    3,977    4,307    (7.2 )%  (7.7 )% Industrial products   413    443    1,237    1,280    (6.8 )  (3.4 ) Agricultural products   276    265    884    896    4.2   (1.3 ) Coal   399    404    1,158    1,127    (1.2 )  2.8     2,411    2,537    7,256    7,610    (5.0 )  (4.7 ) Railroad operating revenues increased 16.8% in the third quarter and 14.3% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increases in average revenue per car/unit resulting from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, along with increased rates per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes. BNSF\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 7.1% in the third quarter and increased 3.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Results for the third quarter were impacted by lower freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs, partially offset by higher revenue per car. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.4 billion in the third quarter and $7.0 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 15.3% and 14.5%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 7.2% in the third quarter and 7.7% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain disruptions. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 7.1% and 6.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 6.8% in the third quarter and 3.4% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The volume decreases in both the third quarter and first nine months were primarily due to lower petroleum and building products shipments. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and $4.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 25.7% and 12.0%, respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased 4.2% in the third quarter due to higher domestic grain shipments and increased renewable diesel and oil feedstock shipments, while volumes decreased 1.3% in the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and oil feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $3.0 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 27.0% and 28.8%, respectively, from 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased 1.2% in the third quarter primarily due to network challenges, while volumes increased 2.8% in the first nine months of 2022 due to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $4.4 billion in the third quarter and $12.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of $1.1 billion (32.8%) and $2.2 billion (21.8%), respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 8.2 percentage points to 67.7% in the third quarter and 4.0 percentage points to 65.2% in the first nine months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $311 million (26.6%) in the third quarter and $439 million (12.6%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from tentative or ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $567 million (80.4%) in the third quarter and $1.5 billion (75.0%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $170 million (50.3%) in the third quarter and $232 million (18.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to general inflation, lower gains from land and easement sales and higher casualty costs. Approximately 30,500 of BNSF\u2019s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were engaged in negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. Federal mediation was included in that timeframe, followed by a release from the National Mediation Board for a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB). In accordance with the Railway Labor Act (RLA), the PEB issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these recommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. To date, six unions have ratified those agreements. Two labor unions did not ratify their tentative agreement, and the parties have agreed to maintain the status quo as discussions continue. Ratification results for the remaining unions are scheduled to be announced through November 2022. Where settlements have not been successful following the RLA process, Congress may act by extending the status quo period or passing a law imposing a resolution on the parties. 33  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE\u2019s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings increased $76 million in the third quarter and decreased $106 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The changes reflected increases in utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher production tax credits recognized in the third quarter and higher operating expenses. The increases in operating expenses reflected higher accruals in the first nine months of 2022 associated with wildfires in 2020, higher general and plant maintenance costs and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp\u2019s utility margin was $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of $68 million and $88 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2021. The increases reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.5% in the third quarter and 0.8% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $73 million in the third quarter and increased $17 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The changes reflected increases in electric utility margin offset by higher operating expenses and lower other income. Additionally, comparative income tax benefits were lower in the third quarter and higher in the first nine months of 2022, as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered and solar-powered generating facilities placed in-service ($14 million in the third quarter and $106 million in the first nine months) were offset by the impacts of ratemaking. The increase in operating expenses included higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms. MEC\u2019s electric utility margin was $774 million in the third quarter and $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 12% and 15%, respectively, versus 2021. The increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from increased retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by higher purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in the third quarter and 4.0% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $12 million in the third quarter and $24 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher accruals for earnings sharing and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service, partially offset by higher interest income from carrying charges on regulatory balances. NV Energy\u2019s electric utility margin was $622 million in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.3% in the third quarter and 1.3% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid\u2019s after-tax earnings increased $17 million in the third quarter and $120 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the first nine months of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. In addition, earnings increased at CE Gas from new projects placed in-service in March and July 2022 and improved distribution business results largely from higher tariff rates, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in 2022. Natural gas pipelines\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $88 million in the third quarter and $102 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher earnings at BHE GT&S, largely from the impacts of a general rate case, favorable income tax adjustments and lower operating expenses. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by reduced margins in 2022 due to higher natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in 2021, attributable to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $13 million in the third quarter and $205 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings were primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $24 million in the third quarter and $182 million in the first nine months of 2022 as well as from higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects, partly offset by lower earnings from natural gas generating facilities. The increases in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. The comparative increase in year-to-date earnings also reflected the impact of losses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms. 35  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy\n(Continued) Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $73 million in the third quarter and $187 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases in earnings were primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume primarily from a decline in refinancing activity and lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $38 million in the third quarter and was relatively unchanged for the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher federal income tax credits recognized, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower earnings from non-regulated energy services in the first nine months.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group increased $531 million (7.4%) in the third quarter and $1.9 billion (8.8%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased $251 million (22.3%) in the third quarter and $353 million (10.1%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.9% for the first nine months of 2022, an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to 2021. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. Operating results of this group\u2019s international businesses were also negatively impacted in 2022 by the stronger U.S. Dollar. PCC\u2019s revenues were $1.9 billion in the third quarter and $5.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 17.5% in the third quarter and 14.5% in the first nine months compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2022 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Further recovery likely will be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of COVID-19, as well as from the changes in supply chain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, which resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings declined $37 million in the third quarter and $13 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impacts of a year-to-date reduction in pension plan income of $43 million, as well as increased costs related to labor, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions. PCC management continues to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for PCC\u2019s products. Growth in PCC\u2019s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and employment environments. Lubrizol\u2019s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the third quarter and $5.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 6.5% in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first nine months compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes through the first nine months of 2022 were restricted by unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns and raw material supply constraints, which limited Lubrizol\u2019s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased $251 million in the third quarter and $249 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in earnings was driven by fire-related insurance recoveries in 2022, while earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by significant losses related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment charges in the third quarter of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Insurance recoveries related to a fire in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and the Rockton, Illinois facility fire were $142 million in the third quarter and $242 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $10 million of insurance recoveries in the third quarter and $55 million in the first nine months of 2021. The fire losses related to the Rockton, Illinois fire and impairment charges in 2021 aggregated $73 million in the third quarter and $229 million in the first nine months of 2021. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher expenses from the unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. in the first quarter, which resulted in lost sales and various incremental and non-recurring manufacturing and other operating costs. 37  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon\u2019s revenues were $2.7 billion in the third quarter and $8.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 4.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% in the first nine months compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon\u2019s business groups generated higher revenues in the first nine months of 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Metal Services, Industrial and Electrical products groups, which contributed approximately 76% of the increase. These increases generally reflected favorable volume and sales mix and higher metals prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Metals prices in the third quarter of 2022 began to moderate and in certain instances declined. Revenues of the Rail & Leasing group in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 declined versus 2021, due primarily to low product sales volumes and declining lease rates. Marmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 14.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the first nine months of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its business in Russia. In the first nine months of 2022, the Transportation, Metal Services, Plumbing, Electrical, Retail and Industrial Products groups contributed meaningful increases in earnings, due to a combination of higher sales volumes and margins. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group. IMC\u2019s revenues were $905 million in the third quarter and $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 5.0% compared to the same periods in 2021. Revenues in 2022 reflected increased sales in several geographic regions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia and effects from foreign currency translation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.3% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, as the revenue increases were more than offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $1.2 billion (19.1%) in the third quarter and $3.6 billion (19.6%) in the first nine months of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $403 million (48.4%) in the third quarter and $1.1 billion (43.1%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Our building products businesses have benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly over the first nine months of 2022. As a result, the significant increase in home mortgage interest rates has slowed demand for new home construction. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near term will likely decline from current levels. Clayton Homes\u2019 revenues increased 24.8% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter and 24.9% to $9.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (30.2%) in the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. New home unit sales increased 9.5% in the first nine months of 2022, reflecting a 10.5% increase in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 5.4% increase in site-built home unit sales. We expect unit sales will likely decline in the near term, as a consequence of higher interest rates. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $20.4 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of approximately $1.6 billion from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $249 million (63.8%) in the third quarter and $512 million (41.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest income, as well as relatively low credit losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $4.3 billion in the third quarter and $12.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of $565 million (15.1%) in the third quarter and $1.7 billion (15.9%) in the first nine months versus 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $154 million (34.9%) in the third quarter and $600 million (44.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 3.1 percentage points versus 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as a comparative increase in pre-tax gains from business divestitures and asset sales of $58 million in the third quarter and $169 million in the first nine months. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the negative impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other operating costs. 38  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products group revenues decreased $242 million (6.2%) in the third quarter and increased $903 million (7.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Forest River\u2019s revenues declined 7.2% in the third quarter and increased 22.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Forest River\u2019s unit sales declined 27.9% in the third quarter and 5.3% in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. The comparative decline in unit volume in the third quarter was attributable to reduced consumer demand. Over the first nine months of 2022, Forest River\u2019s revenues reflected higher average selling prices, resulting from higher material prices and supply chain costs. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $27 million (2.0%) in the third quarter and $165 million (4.2%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (5.6% in the third quarter and 8.5% in the first nine months), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The declines in apparel revenues were driven by lower volumes, as retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell\u2019s revenues in first nine months of 2022 declined 6.9% versus 2021, primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $216 million (44.3%) in the third quarter and $324 million (21.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.6 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The declines in earnings in 2022 reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses and from Duracell. The comparative decline in earnings in the first nine months was partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Apparel and footwear earnings declined about 75% in the third quarter and 58% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Our apparel businesses continue to be negatively affected by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. We expect that the comparative operating earnings will likely be lower in the fourth quarter, due to low customer demand and high costs. Duracell\u2019s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects. Earnings from Forest River were essentially unchanged in the third quarter and higher in the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River\u2019s comparative revenues and earnings to decline over the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).   Third Quarter   First Nine Months   2022  2021   2022  2021  Revenues          Service $ 4,771  $ 4,131   $ 14,031  $ 11,718  Retailing  4,796   4,548    14,268   13,896  McLane  13,569   12,612    39,346   36,529   $ 23,136  $ 21,291   $ 67,645  $ 62,143  Pre-tax earnings          Service $ 806  $ 696   $ 2,286  $ 2,013  Retailing  396   414    1,250   1,221  McLane  112   (8 )   270   179   $ 1,314  $ 1,102   $ 3,806  $ 3,413  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues          Service  16.9 %  16.8 %   16.3 %  17.2 % Retailing  8.3 %  9.1 %   8.8 %  8.8 % McLane  0.8 %  (0.1 )%   0.7 %  0.5 %  39  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased $640 million (15.5%) in the third quarter and $2.3 billion (19.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 16.6% in the third quarter and 20.3% in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. However, during the third quarter of 2022, new orders slowed in certain regions and markets, in part attributable to inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 14.2% in the third quarter and 19.9% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (17%), customer flight hours (14%), most of which occurred in the first half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer flight hours and significant increases in fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $110 million (15.8%) in the third quarter and $273 million (13.6%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase in the third quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to aviation services, reflecting a significant comparative decline in subcontract aircraft utilization, and to a lesser extent, increased earnings from several of our other businesses. The comparative increase in earnings in the first nine months reflected higher earnings from TTI, primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. Earnings from aviation services for the first nine months of 2022 decreased compared to 2021, attributable to a significant increase in subcontracted aircraft utilization due to the increase in customer flight hours in the first half of the year, and from higher equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increase in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 66% of our combined retailing revenue in the first nine months of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first nine months of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues increased $248 million (5.5%) in the third quarter and $372 million (2.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021 reflecting increases at BHA, partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA\u2019s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 increased 11.3% and 6.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Revenues from new and used vehicle sales increased 10.9% in the third quarter and 5.4% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from vehicle sales reflected higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales on a year-to-date comparative basis. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by OEMs, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Revenues from service and repair and finance and service contract revenues each increased versus 2021. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $18 million (4.3%) in the third quarter and increased $29 million (2.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 24.7% in the third quarter and 22.7% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold and from operating cost control efforts. BHA\u2019s comparative new vehicle gross profit margin rates began to accelerate during the second half of 2021, as a consequence of low available inventory attributable to supply chain constraints impacting the OEMs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $68 million (32.2%) in the third quarter and $103 million (15.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to declining earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. 40  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in the first nine months of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane\u2019s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues increased $957 million (7.6%) in the third quarter and $2.8 billion (7.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting year-to-date increases of 3.9% from the grocery business and 15.2% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings increased $120 million in the third quarter and $91 million (50.8%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings reflected slightly higher gross margin rates in the grocery and foodservice businesses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs. McLane\u2019s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages and higher inventory costs. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue for the remainder of 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions).   Third Quarter   First Nine Months    2022   2021   2022   2021  Investment gains (losses)  $ (13,500 )  $ 4,851   $ (82,089 )  $ 37,235  Derivative contract gains (losses)   35    70    (273 )   780  Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (13,465 )   4,921    (82,362 )   38,015  Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   (3,016 )   1,043    (17,295 )   8,036  Net earnings (loss)  $ (10,449 )  $ 3,878   $ (65,067 )  $ 29,979  Effective income tax rate   20.9 %   20.7 %   20.8 %   20.9 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized losses of $12.9 billion in the third quarter and $80.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $4.8 billion in the third quarter and $36.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $3 million in the third quarter and taxable losses of $660 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $0.9 billion in the third quarter and $2.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. As of September 30, 2022, our recorded liability at fair value was less than $1 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. 41  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).   Third Quarter   First Nine Months   2022   2021   2022   2021  Equity method earnings $ 362   $ 310   $ 874   $ 665  Acquisition accounting expenses  (161 )   (169 )   (484 )   (532 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects  (66 )   (75 )   (203 )   (232 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains on Berkshire and BHFC\nnon-U.S. Dollar senior notes  858    196    2,441    676  Other  48    87    207    76   $ 1,041   $ 349   $ 2,835   $ 653   After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Equity method earnings increased $209 million in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, equity method earnings will also include Occidental Petroleum. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire\u2019s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire\u2019s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC\u2019s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. These gains were largely offset by losses included in investment gains/losses, pertaining to non-U.S. Dollar denominated investments held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings/losses consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at September 30, 2022 was $455.4 billion, a decrease of $50.8 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $41.0 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $64.9 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At September 30, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $105.2 billion, which included $77.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $324.8 billion. During the first nine months of 2022, we paid cash of $66.2 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $17.3 billion from sales of equity securities. On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for cash consideration of $11.6 billion, which was funded by existing cash balances. Our consolidated borrowings at September 30, 2022 were $116.5 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $10.2 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.3 billion on maturing term debt. 42  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition\n(Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at September 30, 2022 was $19.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion since December 31, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire\u2019s borrowings decreased $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months approximate $4.2 billion, all of which is in the first six months of 2023. Berkshire\u2019s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $22.3 billion at September 30, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $17.6 billion. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued \u20ac1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the first nine months of 2022 were $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $23.3 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $83 million from December 31, 2021. In June 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053. During the first nine months of 2022, BNSF repaid approximately $900 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.7 billion at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $112 million from December 31, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053, and during the first nine months of 2022, subsidiaries issued approximately $1.3 billion of fixed and variable rate term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% as of September 30, 2022 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $3.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $27.0 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $10.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $7.9 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Forecasted capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2022 approximate $3.7 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cthe 2022 act\u201d) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on \u201cadjusted financial statement income\u201d, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We currently do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect future guidance from the Treasury Department and will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $128.3 billion at September 30, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of September 30, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. 43  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations\n(Continued) On March 20, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion. On October 19, 2022, the acquisition of Alleghany closed. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $128.3 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.3 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.4 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with that annual goodwill impairment review, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of September 30, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and changes in business conditions on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit\u2019s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 44  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati\nve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the \u201cMarket Risk Disclosures\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of September 30, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls\nand Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other\nInformation Item 1. Legal\nProceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris\nk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 45  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o\nf Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire\u2019s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the third quarter of 2022 follows.  Period Total number of\nshares purchased   Average price\npaid per share   Total number of\nshares purchased\nas part of publicly\nannounced program   Maximum number or\nvalue of shares that yet\nmay be repurchased\nunder the program July           Class A common stock  1,302   $ 424,974.96    1,302   * Class B common stock  \u2014   $ \u2014    \u2014   *            August           Class A common stock  595   $ 444,401.28    595   * Class B common stock  \u2014   $ \u2014    \u2014   *            September           Class A common stock  519   $ 424,972.62    519   * Class B common stock  \u2014   $ \u2014    \u2014   * *\nThe program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire\u2019s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. The development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation in recent years have produced varying effects on our operating businesses. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long Duration Contracts\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d) as of January 1, 2023, which modifies the accounting, reporting and disclosures related to long duration insurance contracts and most significantly the measurement of our long duration life, annuity and health benefit liabilities. ASU 2018-12 was applied retrospectively to contracts in-force beginning as of January 1, 2021 (the \u201ctransition date\u201d). The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2022 and 2021 were revised to reflect the effects of the adoption of ASU 2018-12. As of the transition date, the after-tax impact of changes in cash flow assumptions were recorded in retained earnings and the after-tax effect of changes in discount rates assumptions were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The effects of the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on our Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 1, 2021 and for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Part II, Item 5 of this Report. Beginning as of January 1, 2021, the cash flow assumptions used in measuring benefit liabilities are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. Further, the discount rate assumptions used in measuring benefit liabilities are revised each quarterly reporting period based on the prevailing observable upper-medium grade (generally considered to be single A-rated credit ratings) corporate bond yields that reflect the duration characteristics and currency attributes of the liabilities, using interpolation for durations between the observable yields. Changes to benefits liabilities arising from changes in discount rate assumptions are recorded in other comprehensive income. In measuring benefit liabilities and amortizing capitalized acquisition costs under long duration insurance contracts, we generally aggregate contracts by issuance year. ASU 2018-12 also requires certain disclosures for long duration insurance liabilities. See Note 16. 7  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 2. New accounting pronouncements\n(Continued) The effects from adopting ASU 2018-12 on affected line items from our Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 follows in millions, except per share amounts.

Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional\n41.4\n% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (\u201cPilot\u201d) for approximately $\n8.2\nbillion. We previously owned a\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot and accounted for that investment under the equity method. We now control Pilot for financial reporting purposes. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 and began consolidating Pilot\u2019s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than\n650\ntravel center locations across\n43\nU.S. states and\nsix\nCanadian provinces. Pilot also has over\n150\nretail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Among its business activities, Pilot operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. and operates a water hauling and disposal business in the oil fields sector. As Pilot\u2019s most significant business activities include involve purchasing and selling fuel (energy) on a wholesale and retail basis, and engaging in other energy-related business activities, including oil field services, we have included Pilot within the railroad, utilities and energy sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings beginning February 1, 2023. Pilot\u2019s revenues and net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders included in Berkshire\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements for the two months ending March 31, 2023 were $\n9.5\nbillion and $\n83\nmillion, respectively. Our equity method earnings from Pilot for the month of January 2023 were $\n105\nmillion. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we were required to remeasure our previously held\n38.6\n% investment in Pilot to fair value. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $\n3.0\nbillion, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method, as a component of investment gains (losses). 8  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 3. Significant business acquisitions\n(\nContinued) Under the terms of an agreement, the holder of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Pilot has the option to require us to redeem for cash, all or a portion of the interest beginning in 2024. The cash consideration will be based on Pilot\u2019s future earnings, cash and debt. We have concluded that the remaining Pilot noncontrolling interest represents a redeemable interest under GAAP and are presenting such interests between liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We valued the noncontrolling interest at fair value as of the acquisition date. Thereafter, we will increase or decrease the redeemable noncontrolling interest by the share of the earnings or losses attributable to the interest and will further adjust the balance, as appropriate, if the current estimated redemption value exceeds the carrying value. The preliminary values of the Pilot identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interests are summarized as follows (in millions). Valuations of certain assets and liabilities, including property plant and equipment, other intangible assets and goodwill, as of the acquisition date have not been finalized at this time and are provisional.

Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses.\nA summary of the preliminary values of the Alleghany identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 19, 2022 follows (in millions).

Investments in equity securities\n(Continued) During 2022, we began to acquire common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\u201cOccidental\u201d). Our aggregate voting interest in Occidental exceeded\n20\n% on August 4, 2022 and we adopted the equity method as of that date. See Note 6. We report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. As of March 31, 2023, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $\n9.5\nbillion. During March of 2023, Occidental issued mandatory redemption notifications at a price of\n110\n% of the liquidation value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for $\n474\nmillion of preferred stock liquidation value due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders, as defined under the agreement. The preferred stock accrues dividends at\n8\n% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in\n2029\nat a redemption price equal to\n105\n% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. Our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to\n83.86\nmillion shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $\n59.62\nper share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until\none year\nafter the redemption of the preferred stock. As of March 31, 2023, we owned\n151.6\nmillion shares of American Express Company (\u201cAmerican Express\u201d) common stock representing\n20.4\n% of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 6. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d) and Occidental. We own\n26.5\n% of Kraft Heinz common stock and we own\n23.5\n% of Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of the Occidental common stock warrants that are included in investments in equity securities. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental\u2019s midstream businesses purchase, market, gather, process, transport and store various oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide and other products. Occidental\u2019s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Our earnings in the first quarter of 2023 included our share of Occidental\u2019s earnings from its fourth quarter of 2022. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and carrying values of these investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions).  Carrying Value   Fair Value   March 31,\n2023   December 31,\n2022   March 31,\n2023   December 31,\n2022  Kraft Heinz $ 13,033   $ 12,937   $ 12,585   $ 13,249  Occidental  12,927    11,484    13,217    12,242  Other  443    3,629         $ 26,403   $ 28,050        Our other significant equity method investments included Pilot through January 31, 2023. Beginning February 1, 2023, we ceased accounting for Pilot under the equity method and began consolidating Pilot for financial reporting purposes. Our investment in Pilot under the equity method was $\n3.2\nbillion at December 31, 2022. Other significant equity method investments also included our\n50\n% interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (\u201cBerkadia\u201d) with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (\u201cJefferies\u201d) owning the other\n50\n% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia\u2019s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $\n1.5\nbillion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. The carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximate our share of the net equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2022 by approximately $\n8\nbillion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill. 11  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 6.

Investment and derivative contract gains (losses)\n(Continued) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $\n13.3\nbillion in the first quarter of 2023 and $\n9.7\nbillion in the first quarter of 2022. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $\n2.2\nbillion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to taxable losses of $\n739\nmillion in 2022. Other investment gains in the first quarter of 2023 included approximately $\n3\nbillion from the remeasurement of our pre-existing\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot through the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP. See Note 3. As of March 31, 2023, our exposure to losses in the future under our two outstanding equity index put option contracts is insignificant. Note 8.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims.\nA reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2023 and 2022 follows (in millions).   2023   2022  Balances at beginning of year:      Gross liabilities $ 107,472   $ 86,664  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  (\n5,025 )   (\n2,960 ) Net liabilities  102,447    83,704  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current accident year  14,776    13,375  Prior accident years  (\n740 )   (\n251 ) Total  14,036    13,124  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current accident year  (\n3,841 )   (\n3,908 ) Prior accident years  (\n9,747 )   (\n8,091 ) Total  (\n13,588 )   (\n11,999 ) Foreign currency effect  93    (\n106 ) Balances at March 31:      Net liabilities  102,988    84,723  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  4,969    2,944  Gross liabilities $ 107,957   $ 87,667   Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (\u201ccurrent accident year\u201d) and events occurring in all prior years (\u201cprior accident years\u201d). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first quarter, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $\n740\nmillion in 2023 and $\n251\nmillion in 2022, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were\n0.7\n% in 2023 and\n0.3\n% in 2022. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses in the first quarter by $\n379\nmillion in 2023 and $\n114\nmillion in 2022. In 2023, the reductions were driven by private passenger auto claims, whereas the decreases in 2022 were primarily attributable to private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims, partly offset by increases with respect to other casualty claims. In the first quarter, estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $\n361\nmillion in 2023 and $\n137\nmillion in 2022. 17  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached.\nReconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).  2023   2022  Balances at beginning of year $ 35,415   $ 37,855  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current year contracts  \u2014    \u2014  Prior years\u2019 contracts  14    (\n7 ) Total  14    (\n7 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  (\n372 )   (\n547 ) Foreign currency effect  6    (\n5 ) Balances at March 31 $ 35,063   $ 37,296  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses above $ 14   $ (\n7 ) Deferred charge amortization and adjustments  171    215  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings $ 185   $ 208  In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $\n9.7\nbillion at March 31, 2023 and $\n10.4\nbillion at March 31, 2022. Note 16.

We also reinsure closed blocks of guaranteed minimum death and living benefits associated with variable annuity products, referred to as market risk benefits. Such liabilities are included in other policyholder liabilities and are measured at estimated fair value under ASU 2018-12. Such liabilities were approximately $\n1.2\nbillion as of March 31, 2023 and $\n1.25\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, we reduced liability estimates by $\n65\nmillion, for the effects of changes in securities markets, interest rates and other inputs used to estimate liabilities. Cash settlements during the first quarter of 2023 were insignificant. Note 17.

Notes payable and other borrowings\n(Continued) In the first quarter of 2023, Berkshire repaid approximately $\n3.9\nbillion of maturing senior notes. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. In April 2023, Berkshire issued \u00a5\n164.4\nbillion (approximately $\n1.2\nbillion) of senior notes and repaid \u00a5\n56.3\nbillion of maturing senior notes. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $\n2.7\nbillion at March 31, 2023. Generally, Berkshire\u2019s guarantee of a subsidiary\u2019s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (\u20ac\n6.85\nbillion, \u00a3\n1.75\nbillion and \u00a5\n1,029\nbillion par at March 31, 2023) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax losses of $\n26\nmillion in the first quarter of 2023 and pre-tax gains of $\n716\nmillion in the first quarter of 2022.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. Pilot\u2019s borrowings primarily represent syndicated loans. BNSF\u2019s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. As of March 31, 2023, BNSF, Pilot, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE, Pilot or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $\n13.1\nbillion at March 31, 2023, which included approximately $\n9.0\nbillion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 21  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 18.

Fair value measurements\n(Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1\n\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2\n\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3\n\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).

These investments are private placements with contractual terms that restrict transfers and currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of liquidity and subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 23  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 19.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to\none-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to\none-ten-thousandth\n(1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into\n1,500\nshares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were\n1,450,152\nshares outstanding as of March 31, 2023 and\n1,459,733\nshares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (\n1/1,500\n) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (\n1/1,500\n) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus\n1,500\ntimes the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\nThe program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $\n30\nbillion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 20. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were\n20.1\n% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to\n18.0\n% in the first quarter of 2022. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 24  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 21.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  25  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 24. Revenues from contracts with customers The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 (in millions). Revenues from Pilot in 2023 are for the two months ending March 31, 2023. Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. We acquired control of Pilot Travel Centers (\u201cPilot\u201d) on January 31, 2023. Pilot\u2019s revenues, costs and earnings are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and is considered a reportable segment beginning February 1, 2023. In this presentation, the revenues and pre-tax earnings of the Pilot segment are for the two months ending March 31, 2023. Previously, our earnings from Pilot were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from equity method investments. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. To varying degrees the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect our operating businesses. Government and private sector actions were taken beginning in 2020 intended to control the spread and mitigate the adverse economic effects of the virus and its variants. The development of global geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation in recent years has produced varying economic effects on our operating businesses. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Insurance underwriting generated after-tax earnings of $911 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $167 million in the first quarter of 2022, which was revised from the previously reported amount of $47 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023. See Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $799 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, mostly attributable to increases in short-term interest rates. After-tax earnings of BNSF decreased 9.0% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The comparative decrease was primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of BHE decreased 46.3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease reflected lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in Pilot from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023 and we are consolidating Pilot\u2019s results beginning February 1, 2023. In 2022 and through January 31, 2023, earnings from Pilot on our 38.6% interest were determined under the equity method and are included in non-controlled businesses in the preceding table. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased 1.4% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022. Earnings in the first quarter of 2023 were mixed among our various businesses. While results for certain industrial products manufacturers and services businesses improved versus 2022, the results of the building and consumer products businesses generally deteriorated. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method. 28  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations\n(Continued) Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate losses of $17 million in the first quarter of 2023 and after-tax gains of $522 million in the first quarter of 2022 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (\u201cBHFC\u201d). Insurance\u2014Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophes in the first quarter were Cyclone Gabrielle and floods in New Zealand in 2023 and floods in Australia in 2022. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of March 31, 2023. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d). Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) on October 19, 2022. Through its subsidiaries, Alleghany operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses, which are included in the BH Primary and BHRG underwriting results. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG\u2019s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge asset amortization and discounted liability accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). BHRG\u2019s pre-tax underwriting earnings for the first quarter of 2022 were $301 million, an increase from the previously reported amount of $156 million due to the impact of the retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 with respect to our long duration insurance contracts.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) GEICO GEICO primarily writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone.

Premiums written in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $205 million (2.0%) compared to the first quarter of 2022. Premiums earned increased $72 million (0.8%) as average premiums per auto policy increased 15.2% due to rate increases, offset by a decrease in policies-in-force of 2.4 million (13.0%) since March 31, 2022. GEICO significantly reduced advertising over that period, which contributed to the reduction in policies-in-force. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $552 million (6.5%) compared to the first quarter of 2022. GEICO\u2019s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned in the first quarter of 2023 was 83.0%, a decrease of 6.4 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2022, which reflected the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, favorable reserve development for prior accident years, the reduction in policies-in-force, and lower claims frequencies. Somewhat offsetting the favorable impact of these items were increases in claims severities. GEICO\u2019s reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years\u2019 loss events were $338 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $92 million in the first quarter of 2022. The reduction in loss estimates for prior years\u2019 events in 2023 reflected decreased estimates across several coverages. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2023 were lower for property damage (five to six percent range) and collision (six to seven percent range), while claims frequencies increased for bodily injury (four to five percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2023 were higher for property damage coverage (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range), collision coverage (seven to eight percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $931 million, a decrease of $257 million (21.6%) compared to 2022. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2023 was 9.7% compared to 12.5% in 2022. These decreases were driven by the reduction in advertising expenses. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group consists of several independently managed businesses that provide a variety of primarily commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary\u2019s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d), National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company (\u201cBH Direct\u201d) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d). This group also includes Alleghany\u2019s RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (\u201cAlleghany Insurance\u201d), beginning October 19, 2022. 30  Item 2.

The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($570 million), as well as increased volumes from BH Specialty, BH Direct and USLI. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $382 million (16.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the impact of Alleghany Insurance ($233 million). BH Primary\u2019s loss ratio decreased 5.8 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting changes in business mix (including the impact of Alleghany Insurance), lower incurred losses from current year catastrophes and increased reductions in loss estimates for prior years\u2019 events. Incurred losses from significant catastrophes during the first quarter were $37 million in 2023 and $75 million in 2022. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events of $41 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $22 million in the first quarter of 2022. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors. Underwriting expenses increased $285 million (37.9%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Alleghany Insurance underwriting expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $139 million. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned increased 2.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, Alleghany\u2019s Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (\u201cTransRe Group\u201d). We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d).

Otherwise, premiums written increased $542 million (12.4%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to net increases in new and renewal property business and higher rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.1 billion (46.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily from the inclusion of TransRe Group ($700 million). The loss ratio decreased 2.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Losses incurred from significant catastrophes during the first quarter were $407 million in 2023 and $315 million in 2022. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 events of $361 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $137 million in the first quarter of 2022. The expense ratio increased 6.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix, including the impact of TransRe Group. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2023 included $385 million related to TransRe Group. Underwriting expenses also included foreign currency exchange losses of $74 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to gains of $81 million in the first quarter of 2022, related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

The life insurance contract commutations drove most of the comparative decreases in premiums earned and life and health benefits incurred. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results primarily derive from the runoff of contracts written several years ago. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting losses were $195 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $190 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily related to deferred charge amortization. The effects of foreign currency exchange were relatively insignificant in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. 32  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $35.1 billion at March 31, 2023, a decline of $352 million since December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to paid claims. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.7 billion at March 31, 2023, a decline of $171 million since December 31, 2022. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accruals on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency losses of $19 million in the first quarter of 2023 and gains of $23 million in the first quarter of 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $145 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $142 million in the first quarter of 2022. Discounted liabilities were $15.1 billion at March 31, 2023, which included $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies. We adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023. ASU 2018-12 requires that the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates. The effects of discount rate changes are reflected in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity The run-off of our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $63 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $231 million in the first quarter of 2022. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Insurance\u2014Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).

Income in the first quarter included $8 million in 2023 and $16 million in 2022 from BHE preferred stock. Such amounts were deducted from earnings of the BHE segment. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Interest and other investment income increased $977 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 33  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Investment Income\n(Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $165 billion at March 31, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 and, consequently, the average cost of float was negative.

BNSF\u2019s pre-tax earnings were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an 8.8% decrease compared to 2022. Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the first quarter, a 10.4% decrease from 2022, attributable to 16.4% lower volumes, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from lower west coast imports and the loss of an intermodal customer, partially offset by an increase in automotive volume from higher vehicle production. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a 6.4% increase from 2022, primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.7% decrease in volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower demand for chemicals and plastics, lumber and paper shipments. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an 8.8% increase compared to 2022, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a 15.7% increase from 2022. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 4.2%. The volume decrease derived from weather related impacts and moderating demand due to lower natural gas prices. Railroad operating expenses were $4.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $292 million (7.8%) compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3.8 percentage points to 68.4% versus 2022. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $89 million (7.3%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased headcount, wage inflation, and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $103 million (12.0%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Purchased services expenses increased $12 million (2.4%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to general inflation. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $67 million (12.7%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to general inflation, increased casualty and litigation costs and higher property and other miscellaneous taxes. 35  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d), a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments and an unregulated retail energy services company. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE\u2019s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE\n(Continued) Our U.S. utilities operate in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings decreased $237 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), higher other income and lower state income taxes. Operating expenses increased primarily due to a pre-tax increase of $359 million in loss accruals (net of expected insurance recoveries) associated with the 2020 wildfires, as well as from increases in general and plant maintenance costs. The U.S. utilities\u2019 electric utility margin was $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $62 million (3.8%) compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs and lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 2.6% (3.3% at PacifiCorp, 1.0% at MEC and 2.9% at NV Energy) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to increases in customer usage and in the average number of customers. After-tax earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $47 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases. After-tax earnings of other energy businesses decreased $156 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a deferred income tax charge of $82 million recognized in March 2023 related to the enactment of a new Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom, lower earnings from changes in unrealized positions on derivative contracts and unfavorable results from natural gas, solar and geothermal generating facilities due to increased maintenance costs and lower solar generation due to weather events in California. Partially offsetting these earnings decreases were increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $36 million. After-tax earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $55 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 29% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 41% decrease in closed transaction volumes, attributable to the impact of rising interest rates and a corresponding slowdown in home sales. Pilot On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (\u201cPilot\u201d), and we currently own an 80% controlling interest. Thus, we began consolidating Pilot\u2019s results of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on February 1, 2023. Through January 31, 2023, we owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot, which we accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of Pilot\u2019s net earnings for the month ending January 31, 2023 and first quarter 2022 are included in equity method earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across the U.S. and in six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. A substantial portion of Pilot\u2019s revenues and earnings derive from marketing fuel on a wholesale and retail basis and from other energy-related activities. Our earnings from Pilot for the two months ending March 31, 2023 are summarized below (in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Pilot\n(Continued) Pilot\u2019s revenues and earnings are highly dependent on fuel, prices and margins. Revenues for the two months ending March 31, 2023 were $9.5 billion. Revenues for the first three months of 2023 and 2022 were approximately $14.5 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively. For the first quarter of 2023, Pilot sold approximately 4.7 billion gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and other fuel-related products. Pilot\u2019s pre-tax earnings for the two months ending March 31, 2023 were $136 million. Operating and other expenses included depreciation and amortization expense of $168 million, a significant portion of which derived from depreciation of property, plant and equipment assets and amortization of intangible assets that were remeasured to fair value in connection with the application of the acquisition accounting method in 2023. Fuel prices and margins were elevated in 2022 and remained elevated during the first quarter of 2023. Pilot\u2019s consolidated pre-tax earnings for the three months ending March 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below. Revenues, costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2022 and first month of 2023 are based on Pilot\u2019s historical accounting and are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, whereas such information for the two months ending March 31, 2023 was included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

These expenses are included in \u201cOther\u201d in the summary of earnings on page 28 and in the \u201cOther\u201d earnings section on page 44. 38  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions).     First Quarter       2023   2022  Revenues          Industrial products     $ 8,863   $ 7,475  Building products      6,010    6,712  Consumer products      3,416    4,234       $ 18,289   $ 18,421  Pre-tax earnings          Industrial products     $ 1,441   $ 1,216  Building products      895    1,144  Consumer products      275    464       $ 2,611   $ 2,824  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues          Industrial products      16.3 %   16.3 % Building products      14.9 %   17.0 % Consumer products      8.1 %   11.0 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group also includes businesses acquired in connection with Alleghany consisting of the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel, as well as other businesses that became part of Marmon. Revenues of the industrial products group increased $1.4 billion (18.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $225 million (18.5%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.3% for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022. Operating results of the group in the first quarter of 2023 reflected the impact of business acquisitions and overall improved operating results at our pre-existing businesses. PCC\u2019s revenues were $2.25 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 28.1% compared to 2022. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increase. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 23.0% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Results in 2023 reflected improving manufacturing and operating efficiencies. We are continuing to strive to improve manufacturing efficiencies, maintain safety and prepare for increasing demand for PCC\u2019s products. Continued growth in PCC\u2019s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products demand. Lubrizol\u2019s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.2% compared to 2022. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2023 were attributable to general market weakness in the global economy, resulting in lower demand in certain product lines. Lubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 34.7% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in 2023 were favorably impacted by higher selling prices and favorable product mix, partially offset by the continued rise of raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. 39  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon\u2019s revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 16.4% compared to 2022. Business acquisitions including AP Emissions Technologies and three former Alleghany businesses: Kentucky Trailer, Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc. and Wilbert Plastics Services, accounted for nearly 70% of the growth. Nearly all of Marmon\u2019s business groups generated higher revenues in 2023, led by significant increases in the Rail & Leasing, Transportation, Metal Services and Crane groups, due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. Our Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups faced headwinds in revenue in 2023 attributed to lower steel and copper prices and slowing residential construction activity. Our international businesses were challenged by foreign currency translations as a result of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Marmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2023 increased 13.5% compared to 2022, with business acquisitions accounting for 27% of the increase. Most of Marmon\u2019s business groups generated higher comparative first quarter earnings in 2023, led by the Transportation group, as well as from the Water Technologies, Retail Solutions, Metals Services and Crane Services groups, primarily attributable to revenue growth. The first quarter earnings increase was partly offset by lower earnings in the Electrical group driven by falling demand and compressing margins in the building wire business and the Rail & Leasing group attributable to higher repair costs and lower railcar disposal gains. IMC\u2019s revenues were $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.2% compared to 2022. Revenues in 2023 reflected increased organic sales in North America and from business acquisitions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 3.5% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The impact of higher revenues was partially offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group decreased $702 million (10.5%) in the first quarter of 2023 and pre-tax earnings decreased $249 million (21.8%) compared to 2022. Our building products businesses have benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment and strong residential and commercial construction markets. The effects of significant increases in interest rates, including home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. over the past year, has slowed demand for our home building businesses and certain of our other building products businesses. As such, our businesses are likely to experience declines in comparative revenues and earnings over the remainder of 2023. Clayton Homes\u2019 revenues decreased 10.7% to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $353 million (15.8%) in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting lower unit sales partially offset by higher average selling prices. New home unit sales decreased 18.0% in the first quarter of 2023, including a 16.9% decrease in factory-built manufactured homes and a 23.1% decrease in site-built home unit sales. We expect unit sales will continue to remain below 2022 in the near term. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 8.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.8 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of 2.3% from December 31, 2022. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes decreased $78 million (16.1%) in the first quarter 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to lower sales volumes. Earnings from financial services declined 9.3% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, reflecting increased expected loan loss provisions and higher operating and interest expenses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $401 million (10.3%) versus 2022. Comparative revenues were lower at all our other building products businesses, generally due to lower sales volumes, partly offset by higher average prices. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses decreased $170 million (25.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2023 decreased 2.9 percentage points versus 2022. Earnings in 2023 at certain of our businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales and reduced gross sales margins. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as a pre-tax gain from a business divestiture of $94 million. 40  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (Jazwares), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Consumer products group revenues decreased $818 million (19.3%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected lower revenues at Forest River and certain of our apparel and footwear operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition. Forest River\u2019s revenues declined 38.6% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an overall 44% decline in unit sales. Forest River experienced strong unit sales in recent years and through the first half of 2022. Since then, volumes have declined, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $68 million (5.7%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (12.1%), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The decline in apparel revenue was driven by lower volume, as order delays and cancellations persisted in response to the elevated inventory levels of retail business customers. Duracell\u2019s revenues in first quarter of 2023 declined 4.5% versus 2022, primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $189 million (40.7%) in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from Forest River and the apparel and footwear businesses. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Apparel and footwear earnings declined 18% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Our apparel businesses continue to be negatively affected by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher manufacturing costs. We expect that comparative operating earnings of these businesses will be lower in the near term. Earnings from Forest River declined 57%, primarily due to the decrease in unit sales, which reduced manufacturing efficiencies, and from unfavorable changes in product mix. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will remain relatively low and Forest River\u2019s earnings in the near term to decline versus 2022. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).     First Quarter      2023  2022  Revenues        Service    $ 5,319  $ 4,523  Retailing     4,612   4,592  McLane     13,059   12,515      $ 22,990  $ 21,630  Pre-tax earnings        Service    $ 837  $ 724  Retailing     384   411  McLane     113   82      $ 1,334  $ 1,217  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues        Service     15.7 %  16.0 % Retailing     8.3 %  9.0 % McLane     0.9 %  0.7 %  41  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training services and products to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management. Service group revenues increased $796 million (17.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues from aviation services, the impact of the IPS acquisition ($302 million), and increased revenues from TTI. Revenues of TTI increased 5.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. TTI sales levels during 2022 were relatively strong. However, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, new orders slowed in certain regions and markets, in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. These conditions are expected to continue in 2023 and we may experience comparative revenue declines in future periods. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and in flight hours across NetJets\u2019 various programs, as well as higher average rates. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $113 million (15.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.3 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase was primarily attributable to higher overall margin rates in aviation services businesses, primarily due to changes in business mix, and to the impact of the IPS acquisition. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 67% of our combined retailing revenue in the first quarter of 2023. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 18% of the combined retailing revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase at BHA, offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA\u2019s revenues in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3.6% compared to 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 6.9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 while revenues from pre-owned vehicle sales declined 4.0%. Unit sales in the first quarter of 2023 increased 0.9%, primarily from new vehicles. While new vehicle levels remain well below historical levels, supplies continue to gradually increase. Revenues from BHA\u2019s service/repair operations in the first quarter of 2023 increased 11.1% versus 2022. Other retailing revenues declined 5.5% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to lower sales volumes at our home furnishings businesses. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $27 million (6.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 30.9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA\u2019s earnings increase reflected higher earnings from service/repair and finance/service contract operations and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle sales margins and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA\u2019s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates, before the effects of LIFO, peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $91 million (45.1%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 49.6% decrease in earnings from the home furnishings businesses, and the impact of a gain in 2022 related to the divestiture of certain jewelry stores. 42  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins and operate in a highly competitive environment. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2023, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane\u2019s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues increased $544 million (4.3%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase of 3.5% from the grocery business and 5.7% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings increased $31 million (37.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in earnings reflected a slight increase in the gross sales margin rate, partly offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum, Pilot and Berkadia. Earnings attributable to these businesses increased $286 million in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to earnings from the inclusion of Occidental Petroleum in 2023. As of January 31, 2023, Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in Pilot. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 on our pre-existing 38.6% interest and began consolidating Pilot\u2019s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. See Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions).   First Quarter    2023   2022  Investment gains (losses)  $ 34,758   $ (1,735 ) Derivative contract gains (losses)   \u2014    (243 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   34,758    (1,978 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   7,319    (398 ) Net earnings (loss)  $ 27,439   $ (1,580 ) Effective income tax rate   20.9 %   16.0 % Investment gains (losses) Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses in the first quarter included net unrealized gains of $31.3 billion in 2023 compared to net unrealized losses of $1.8 billion in 2022 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains and losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities in the first quarter produced taxable gains of $2.2 billion in 2023 compared to taxable losses of $739 million in 2022. Pre-tax investment gains in the first quarter of 2023 included a non-cash gain of $3 billion related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing interest in Pilot to fair value through the application of acquisition accounting upon attaining control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains (losses) Derivative contract gains and losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. Substantially all of our contracts have expired and our exposure to loss in the future is insignificant. 43  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).     First Quarter       2023   2022  Acquisition accounting expenses     $ (202 )  $ (161 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects      (64 )   (70 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire\nand BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes      (17 )   522  Other earnings      172    79       $ (111 )  $ 370   After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire\u2019s business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire\u2019s and BHFC\u2019s Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Our Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity at March 31, 2023 was $504.6 billion, an increase of $31.1 billion since December 31, 2022. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $35.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which included after-tax gains on our investments of $27.4 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At March 31, 2023, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $127.7 billion, which included $106.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $350.7 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we paid cash of $2.9 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $13.3 billion from sales of equity securities. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion. Our consolidated borrowings at March 31, 2023 were $123.6 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF, BHE and its subsidiaries and Pilot. In the first quarter of 2023, we paid approximately $6.2 billion on maturing term debt and increased short-term borrowings by approximately $1.1 billion. 44  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition\n(Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at March 31, 2023 was $17.5 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion since December 31, 2022 due to repayments of maturing debt during the first quarter. In April 2023, Berkshire issued \u00a5164.4 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) of senior notes and repaid \u00a556.3 billion of maturing notes. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at March 31, 2023, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2022. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $22.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $705 million from December 31, 2022. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.0 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $215 million from December 31, 2022. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $3.9 billion. Borrowings of Pilot were $6.5 billion as of March 31,2023, of which $5.9 billion was outstanding as of the January 31, 2023 acquisition date. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt or other borrowings issued by BNSF, BHE, Pilot or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. In the first quarter of 2023, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $8.7 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF, BHE and Pilot) of $2.6 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Forecasted capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2023 approximate $11.7 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cthe 2022 act\u201d) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on \u201cadjusted financial statement income\u201d, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $143 billion at March 31, 2023. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of March 31, 2023, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. 45  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations\n(Continued) Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2023 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023 includes estimated liabilities of $143 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023 included goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $83 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $21 billion, which included $9.5 billion of goodwill associated with the Alleghany and Pilot acquisitions. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of March 31, 2023, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and general changes in business conditions on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units are inherently subjective and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit\u2019s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 46  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati\nve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in particular the \u201cMarket Risk Disclosures\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of March 31, 2023, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report. Item 4. Controls\nand Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other\nInformation Item 1. Legal\nProceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris\nk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 47  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o\nf Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire\u2019s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2023 follows.  Period Total number of\nshares purchased   Average price\npaid per share   Total number of\nshares purchased\nas part of publicly\nannounced program   Maximum number or\nvalue of shares that yet\nmay be repurchased\nunder the program January           Class A common stock  468   $ 475,158.19    468   * Class B common stock  1,323,333   $ 310.87    1,323,333   *            February           Class A common stock  249   $ 464,461.13    249   * Class B common stock  892,938   $ 304.58    892,938   *            March           Class A common stock  4,386   $ 465,791.01    4,386   * Class B common stock  4,500,593   $ 305.57    4,500,593   * *       The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion. Item 3. Defaults Upo\nn Senior Securities None Item 4. Mine Safe\nty Disclosures Information regarding the Company\u2019s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-Q. Item 5. Other Information As disclosed in Notes 2 and 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q, we adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 on the modified retrospective basis beginning as of the January 1, 2021 transition date. Most significantly, ASU 2018-12 changed the measurement of our long duration life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, primarily attributable to changes in discount rate assumptions used in measuring such liabilities. ASU 2018-12 also made relatively minor modifications to the accounting for deferred policy acquisition cost amortization and changed the classification and measurement of certain market risk benefit liabilities, such as those related to variable annuity contracts. 48  Item 5.

Financial Statements 7  BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2023 Note 1. General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire\u2019s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For several reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d) as of January 1, 2023, which modifies the accounting, reporting and disclosures related to long-duration insurance contracts, including the measurement of our long-duration life, annuity and health benefit liabilities. ASU 2018-12 was applied retrospectively to contracts in-force beginning as of January 1, 2021 (the \u201ctransition date\u201d). As of the transition date, the after-tax impact of changes in cash flow assumptions were recorded in retained earnings and the after-tax effect of changes in discount rate assumptions were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 and as of the January 1, 2021 transition date were revised for the effects of adopting ASU 2018-12. These effects were included in Part II, Item 5 to our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2023. Beginning as of January 1, 2021, the cash flow assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are revised each quarterly reporting period with the effects of changes reported in other comprehensive income. Discount rates are based on the prevailing upper-medium grade corporate bond yields (generally single A-rated credit ratings) that reflect the duration characteristics and currency attributes of the liabilities. In measuring benefit liabilities and amortizing capitalized acquisition costs under long-duration insurance contracts, we generally aggregate contracts by issuance year. See Note 16 for disclosures related to our long-duration insurance contracts. A summary of the impacts of adopting ASU 2018-12 on our periodic payment annuity and life and health insurance benefits liabilities as of the January 1, 2021 transition date follows in millions.

New accounting pronouncements\n(\nContinued) The reclassifications to other policyholder liabilities are primarily related to certain liabilities arising under our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts. These liabilities are not classified as life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities under ASU 2018-12. The effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 follows in millions, except per share amounts.

ASU 2023-02 permits reporting entities to elect to account for tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Currently, the proportional amortization method is limited to certain affordable housing tax credit investments. ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and is applied either on a retrospective basis beginning as of the earliest period presented or a modified retrospective basis in the period of adoption. We are evaluating the effects of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 3. Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional\n41.4\n% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (\u201cPilot\u201d) for approximately $\n8.2\nbillion. We previously owned a\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot and accounted for that investment under the equity method. We now possess a controlling interest in Pilot for financial reporting purposes. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 and began consolidating Pilot\u2019s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than\n650\ntravel center locations across\n43\nU.S. states and\nsix\nCanadian provinces. Pilot also has over\n150\nretail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Among its business activities, Pilot operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. and operates a water hauling and disposal business in the oil fields sector. As Pilot\u2019s most significant business activities involve purchasing and selling fuel (energy) on a wholesale and retail basis, and engaging in other energy-related business activities, including oil field services, we have included Pilot within the railroad, utilities and energy sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings beginning February 1, 2023. 9  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 3. Significant business acquisitions\n(\nContinued) Pilot\u2019s revenues and net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders included in Berkshire\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements for the five months ending June 30, 2023 were $\n24.3\nbillion and $\n197\nmillion, respectively. Our equity method earnings from Pilot for the month of January 2023 were $\n105\nmillion. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we were required to remeasure our previously held\n38.6\n% investment in Pilot to fair value. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $\n3.0\nbillion, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method, as a component of investment gains (losses). The holder of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Pilot has the option to require us to redeem for cash, all or a portion of the interest beginning in 2024. The cash consideration will be based on Pilot\u2019s future earnings, cash and debt. We have concluded that the remaining Pilot noncontrolling interest represents a redeemable interest under GAAP and are presenting such interests between liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We valued the noncontrolling interest at fair value as of the acquisition date. Thereafter, we will increase or decrease the redeemable noncontrolling interest by the share of the earnings or losses attributable to the interest and will further adjust the balance, as appropriate, if the current estimated redemption value exceeds the carrying value. The preliminary values of Pilot\u2019s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interests as of January 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in millions). The valuations of certain assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets and goodwill, as of the acquisition date have not been finalized and are provisional.

Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. Goodwill arising from Berkshire\u2019s acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nA summary of the values of the Alleghany assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 19, 2022 follows (in millions).

Investments in equity securities\n(Continued) During 2022, we began to acquire common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\u201cOccidental\u201d). Our aggregate voting interest in Occidental exceeded\n20\n% on August 4, 2022 and we adopted the equity method as of that date. See Note 6. We report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at\n8\n% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in\n2029\nat a redemption price equal to\n105\n% of the liquidation value, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. As of June 30, 2023, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $\n8.8\nbillion. During the first six months of 2023, Occidental issued mandatory redemption notifications at a price of\n110\n% of the liquidation value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for $\n1.2\nbillion of the aggregate liquidation value. The mandatory redemptions were due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders (as defined under the terms of Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations). Our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to\n83.86\nmillion shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $\n59.62\nper share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until\none year\nafter the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. On June 30, 2023, we owned\n151.6\nmillion shares of American Express Company (\u201cAmerican Express\u201d) common stock representing\n20.6\n% of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 6. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d) and Occidental. As of June 30, 2023, we owned\n26.5\n% of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock and\n25.1\n% of the outstanding Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of the Occidental common stock warrants. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental\u2019s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and our carrying values of these investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions). We evaluated our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental for other-than-temporary impairment as of June 30, 2023, and based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, concluded the recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required.

Equity method investments\n(Continued) Our other significant equity method investments included Pilot through January 31, 2023. Beginning February 1, 2023, we ceased accounting for Pilot under the equity method and began consolidating Pilot for financial reporting purposes. Our investment in Pilot under the equity method was $\n3.2\nbillion at December 31, 2022. Other significant equity method investments also included our\n50\n% interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (\u201cBerkadia\u201d) with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (\u201cJefferies\u201d) owning the other\n50\n% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia\u2019s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $\n1.5\nbillion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. The carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximate our share of the net equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders\u2019 equity as of March 31, 2023 by approximately $\n9\nbillion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill. Our earnings and distributions received from equity method investments are summarized in the following table (in millions). As previously indicated, we are reporting the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Thus, the earnings we recorded in 2023 related to Occidental\u2019s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023. Equity method earnings attributable to Pilot were $\n105\nmillion for the month ending January 31, 2023, $\n95\nmillion for the second quarter of 2022 and $\n202\nmillion for the first six months of 2022.

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $\n25.8\nbillion in the first six months of 2023 and $\n12.0\nbillion in the first six months of 2022. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $\n2.4\nbillion in the second quarter and $\n4.6\nbillion in the first six months of 2023 compared to taxable gains of $\n76\nmillion in the second quarter of 2022 and taxable losses of $\n663\nmillion in the first six months of 2022. Other investment gains in the first six months of 2023 included approximately $\n3\nbillion from the remeasurement of our pre-existing\n38.6\n% interest in Pilot through the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses A reconciliation of the changes in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cclaim liabilities\u201d), excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2023 and 2022 follows (in millions).   2023   2022  Balances at beginning of year:      Gross liabilities $ 107,472   $ 86,664  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  (\n5,025 )   (\n2,960 ) Net liabilities  102,447    83,704  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current accident year  29,827    27,427  Prior accident years  (\n1,948 )   (\n887 ) Total  27,879    26,540  Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current accident year  (\n9,968 )   (\n10,085 ) Prior accident years  (\n16,664 )   (\n13,820 ) Total  (\n26,632 )   (\n23,905 ) Foreign currency effect  267    (\n568 ) Balances at June 30:      Net liabilities  103,961    85,771  Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  5,069    2,789  Gross liabilities $ 109,030   $ 88,560   Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (\u201ccurrent accident year\u201d) and events occurring in all prior years (\u201cprior accident years\u201d). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first six months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $\n1.9\nbillion in 2023 and $\n887\nmillion in 2022, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were\n1.9\n% in 2023 and\n1.1\n% in 2022. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses in the first six months by $\n1.1\nbillion in 2023 and $\n313\nmillion in 2022. In 2023, the reductions were driven by private passenger auto claims, whereas the decreases in 2022 were primarily attributable to private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims, partly offset by increases with respect to other casualty claims. In the first six months, estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $\n883\nmillion in 2023 and $\n574\nmillion in 2022. 18  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date.\nReconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).  2023   2022  Balances at beginning of year $ 35,415   $ 37,855  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:      Current year contracts  \u2014    \u2014  Prior years\u2019 contracts  15    (\n14 ) Total  15    (\n14 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  (\n1,033 )   (\n1,008 ) Foreign currency effect  24    (\n157 ) Balances at June 30 $ 34,421   $ 36,676  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses above $ 15   $ (\n14 ) Deferred charge amortization and adjustments  416    426  Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings $ 431   $ 412  In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $\n9.5\nbillion at June 30, 2023 and $\n9.9\nbillion at December 31, 2022. Note 16.

These liabilities are included in other policyholder liabilities and are measured at estimated fair value under ASU 2018-12. Such liabilities were approximately $\n1.0\nbillion as of June 30, 2023 and $\n1.25\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. During the first six months of 2023, we reduced liability estimates by $\n194\nmillion, for the effects of changes in securities markets, interest rates and other inputs used to estimate liabilities. Cash settlements during the first six months of 2023 were relatively insignificant. Note 17.

Notes payable and other borrowings\n(Continued) In the first six months of 2023, Berkshire repaid approximately $\n4.3\nbillion of maturing senior notes. In April 2023, Berkshire issued \u00a5\n164.4\nbillion (approximately $\n1.2\nbillion) of senior notes. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $\n2.7\nbillion at June 30, 2023. Generally, Berkshire\u2019s guarantee of a subsidiary\u2019s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (\u20ac\n6.85\nbillion, \u00a3\n1.75\nbillion and \u00a5\n1,137\nbillion par at June 30, 2023) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax gains of $\n555\nmillion in the second quarter and $\n529\nmillion in the first six months of 2023 as compared to pre-tax gains of $\n1.4\nbillion in the second quarter and $\n2.1\nbillion in the first six months of 2022.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In May 2023, a BHE subsidiary issued $\n1.2\nbillion of\n5.5\n% first mortgage bonds due in\n2054\n. During the first six months of 2023, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid approximately $\n1.4\nbillion of term debt. Pilot\u2019s borrowings primarily represent secured syndicated loans. BNSF\u2019s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2023, BNSF issued $\n1.6\nbillion of\n5.2\n% debentures due in\n2054\n. During the first six months of 2023, BNSF repaid approximately $\n700\nmillion of term debt. As of June 30, 2023, BHE, BNSF and Pilot and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BHE, BNSF, Pilot or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $\n12.0\nbillion at June 30, 2023, which included approximately $\n8.6\nbillion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 22  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 18.

Fair value measurements\n(Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1\n\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2\n\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3\n\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).

These investments are private placements with contractual terms that restrict transfers and currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of liquidity and subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 24  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 19.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to\none-fifteen-hundredth\n(1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to\none-ten-thousandth\n(1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into\n1,500\nshares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were\n1,447,541\nshares outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and\n1,459,733\nshares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (\n1/1,500\n) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (\n1/1,500\n) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus\n1,500\ntimes the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\nThe program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $\n30\nbillion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 20. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were\n20.3\n% in the second quarter and\n20.2\n% in the first six months of 2023 compared to\n21.8\n% in the second quarter and\n22.4\n% in the first six months of 2022. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions, and enacted changes thereto. 25  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 21.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. Generally, we do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire\u2019s\n92\n% owned subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), operates as a regulated electric utility in Oregon and other Western states. In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires (the \u201c2020 Wildfires\u201d), which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp\u2019s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over\n500,000\nacres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over\n2,000\nstructures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. 26  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 23. Contingencies and commitments\n(Continued) Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing and being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. Numerous lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2020 Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint against PacifiCorp that was filed in 2020, captioned\nJeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al.,\nin Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon (the \u201cJames case\u201d). Amounts sought in the lawsuits, complaints and demands filed in Oregon total over $\n7\nbillion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are not included in this amount. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned lawsuits. Additionally, certain governmental agencies have informed PacifiCorp that they are contemplating filing actions in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. In June 2023, a jury issued a verdict for the\n17\nnamed plaintiffs in the James case. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, non-economic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. PacifiCorp intends to vigorously appeal the jury\u2019s findings and damage awards, including whether the case can proceed as a class action. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. Based on the facts and circumstances available to us as of the date of this filing, which includes the status of the verdict in the James case with respect to the\n17\nnamed plaintiffs, other litigation and recent settlements, PacifiCorp has accrued cumulative estimated pre-tax probable losses associated with the 2020 Wildfires of $\n1,018\nmillion through June 30, 2023, or $\n608\nmillion net of probable insurance recoveries. PacifiCorp\u2019s cumulative accrual includes estimates of probable losses for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and non-economic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is reasonably able to estimate at this time. For certain aspects of the 2020 Wildfires for which loss is considered probable, information necessary to reasonably estimate the potential losses, such as those related to certain areas of natural resource damages, is not currently available. It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur significant additional losses beyond the amounts currently accrued; however, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case, the variation in those types of properties and lack of available details and the ultimate outcome of legal actions. On July 10, 2023, BHE announced that it had executed an agreement to acquire an additional\n50\n% interest in Cove Point LNG, LP, which would increase its interest to\n75\n%. The transaction is valued at $\n3.3\nbillion and is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. 27  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued) Note 24. Revenues from contracts with customers The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 and 2022 (in millions).

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. We acquired control of Pilot Travel Centers (\u201cPilot\u201d) on January 31, 2023. Pilot\u2019s revenues, costs and earnings are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, and Pilot is considered a reportable segment beginning February 1, 2023. In this presentation, the revenues and pre-tax earnings of the Pilot segment are for the five months ending June 30, 2023. Previously, our earnings from Pilot were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from equity method investments.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions taken to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of global geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Insurance underwriting generated earnings of $1.25 billion in the second quarter and $2.16 billion in the first six months of 2023 versus $715 million in the second quarter and $882 million in the first six months of 2022. Earnings in 2022 reflect increases of $134 million in the second quarter and $254 million in the first six months from the previously reported amounts attributable to the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023. Earnings from insurance investment income increased $463 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to higher short-term interest rates, partly offset by lower dividend income. Earnings of BNSF declined 24.0% in the second quarter and 17.3% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, offset by lower fuel costs. After-tax earnings of BHE were essentially unchanged in the second quarter and declined 23.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline in the first six months reflected lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in Pilot from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023 and we are consolidating Pilot\u2019s results beginning February 1, 2023. In 2022 and through January 31, 2023, earnings from Pilot on our 38.6% interest were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from non-controlled businesses in the preceding table. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 1.5% in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022. While earnings for certain industrial products manufacturers and services businesses improved versus 2022, earnings of several of our building products, consumer products and retailing businesses deteriorated. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each period of 2023 and 2022 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method. 31  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations\n(Continued) Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $465 million in the second quarter and $448 million in the first six months of 2023 and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2022. These gains related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (\u201cBHFC\u201d). Insurance\u2014Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate the economic performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first six months of 2023 were a cyclone and floods in New Zealand and floods in Australia in 2022. Each of these events occurred in the first quarter of the year. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of June 30, 2023. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d). Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (\u201cAlleghany\u201d) on October 19, 2022. Alleghany operates a property and casualty insurance business through its subsidiaries, RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (\u201cRSUI and CapSpecialty\u201d or \u201cAlleghany Insurance\u201d), and a reinsurance business through Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (\u201cTransRe Group\u201d). Underwriting results of Alleghany Insurance are included in BH Primary and underwriting results of TransRe Group are included in BHRG. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG\u2019s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for policies written by these businesses. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge asset amortization and discounted liability accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). BHRG\u2019s pre-tax underwriting earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 increased $174 million and $319 million, respectively, from pre-tax earnings previously reported due to the adoption of ASU 2018-12.

Premiums written and earned were substantially unchanged in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Premiums in 2023 reflected rate increases during the past 12 months that produced higher average premiums per auto policy (16.3%), as well as a 2.7 million decrease (14.4%) in policies-in-force over that period. GEICO significantly reduced advertising in 2022 and 2023, which contributed to the reduction in policies-in-force. Losses and loss adjustment expenses declined $913 million (10.0%) in the second quarter and $1.5 billion (8.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. GEICO\u2019s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 84.3% in the second quarter and 83.7% in the first six months of 2023, decreases of 8.5 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. These decreases reflected the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, additional reductions in prior accident years\u2019 claims estimates, the reduction in policies-in-force and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2023 included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years\u2019 claims of $888 million compared to $207 million in 2022. The reduction in 2023 reflected decreased estimates across several coverages, while the reductions in 2022 were primarily attributable to bodily and personal injury coverages, partially offset by increases for collision and property damage coverages. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2023 were lower for property damage (seven to eight percent range) and collision (seven to eight percent range) coverages, while claims frequencies increased for bodily injury (three to four percent range) and personal injury (one to two percent range) coverages. Average claims severities in the first six months of 2023 were higher for property damage (twenty-one to twenty-three percent range), collision (seven to nine percent range) and bodily injury (seven to nine percent range) coverages. Underwriting expenses declined $181 million (15.2%) in the second quarter and $438 million (18.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 10.4% in the second quarter and 10.0% in the first six months of 2023, decreases of 1.8 percentage points and 2.2 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. These decreases were driven by the reduction in advertising expenses. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group consists of several independently managed businesses that provide a variety of primarily commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary\u2019s insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d), National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d), Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company (\u201cBH Direct\u201d) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d).

The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($746 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months), as well as comparative increases from BH Specialty and BH Direct. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $618 million (27.6%) in the second quarter and $1.0 billion (22.1%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The loss ratio decreased 0.1 percentage points in the second quarter and 2.9 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting changes in business mix (including the impact of Alleghany Insurance), lower incurred losses from current year catastrophes and increased reductions in loss estimates for prior years\u2019 events. Incurred losses from significant catastrophes occurring in the first six months were $36 million in 2023 and $75 million in 2022. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years\u2019 claims of $177 million in 2023 and $106 million in 2022. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers\u2019 compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Ultimate claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors, including from adverse legal and judicial rulings. Underwriting expenses increased $272 million (32.9%) in the second quarter and $557 million (35.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The expense ratio increased 1.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.5 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily attributable to changes in business mix, including the effects of the Alleghany Insurance acquisition. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, TransRe Group. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d). We assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO and we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. A summary of BHRG\u2019s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions). The retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 resulted in increases in pre-tax earnings of $174 million in the second quarter and $319 million in the first six months of 2022 from the previously reported amounts. These increases derived primarily from reductions in certain variable annuity guarantee liabilities.

Otherwise, premiums written in the first six months of 2023 increased $1.0 billion (11.9%) compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in property business and higher rates. Given the levels of property lines written and that we generally do not retrocede the risks we assume, our periodic underwriting earnings are subject to considerable volatility from significant catastrophe events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $726 million (35.1%) in the second quarter and $1.8 billion (41.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily from the inclusion of TransRe Group ($785 million in the second quarter and $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2023). Overall, the loss ratio decreased 4.1 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Losses incurred from significant catastrophes in the first six months were $528 million in 2023 and $629 million in 2022. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred reflected reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years\u2019 claims of $883 million in the first six months of 2023 and $574 million in the first six months of 2022. Underwriting expenses in 2023 increased $920 million in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months compared to 2022. The expense ratio increased 12.5 percentage points in the second quarter and 9.5 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in business mix, including the impact of TransRe Group. Foreign currency exchange losses were $118 million in the second quarter and $192 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to gains of $308 million in the second quarter and $389 million in the first six months of 2022 and related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting expenses included $385 million in the second quarter and $770 million in the first six months of 2023 related to TransRe Group.

In the first quarter of 2023, several of General Re\u2019s life reinsurance contracts were commuted, which reduced premiums earned by $161 million and life benefits incurred by $304 million. Excluding these effects, premiums earned increased slightly in the second quarter and were substantially unchanged in the first six months of 2023, and life benefits incurred increased 11.8% in the second quarter and 1.5% in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022. The increase in the expense ratio in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022 was primarily attributable to the impact of the life reinsurance contract commutations and increased underwriting expenses. 35  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance\u2014Underwriting\n(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency exchange losses were $18 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to pre-tax gains of $152 million in the second quarter and $157 million in the first six months of 2022. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $245 million in the second quarter and $434 million in the first six months of 2023 and $204 million in the second quarter and $399 million in the first six months of 2022. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $34.4 billion at June 30, 2023, a decline of $1.0 billion since December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to claim payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.5 billion at June 30, 2023, a decline of $416 million since December 31, 2022. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, as well as the level of competition. Beginning in the latter part of 2022, prices for new business have declined to unacceptable levels and we have restricted writing new business. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted liabilities, which includes liabilities for contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency exchange losses of $64 million in the second quarter and $83 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to gains of $86 million in the second quarter and $109 million in the first six months of 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $147 million in the second quarter and $292 million in the first six months of 2023 and $140 million in the second quarter and $282 million in the first six months of 2022. Discounted liabilities were $14.8 billion at June 30, 2023, which included $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies. We adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, which requires that the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates with the effects of discount rate changes included in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $130 million in the second quarter and $193 million in the first six months of 2023 and $147 million in the second quarter and $378 million in the first six months of 2022. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile.

These reductions reflected net dispositions of investments since the end of the second quarter of 2022. Income in the first six months included $17 million in 2023 and $29 million in 2022 from BHE preferred stock. Such amounts were deducted from earnings of the BHE segment. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Interest and other investment income increased $1.2 billion in the second quarter and $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $166 billion at June 30, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in the first six months of 2023 and, consequently, the average cost of float was negative.

Average revenue per car/unit decreased slightly in the second quarter, while average revenue per car/unit increased 6.4% in the first six months of 2023 resulting from higher yield. BNSF\u2019s pre-tax earnings were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.3 billion the first six months of 2023, declines of 24.9% and 17.6%, respectively, compared to 2022. Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.8 billion in the first six months of 2023, decreases of 22.7% and 17.0%, respectively, from 2022. The revenue declines were attributable to volume decreases of 16.1% in the second quarter and 16.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from lower west coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in the trucking market which has impacted our domestic intermodal demand. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in automotive volume from higher vehicle production. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 0.8% and an increase of 2.6%, respectively, from 2022. The decline in the second quarter was primarily due to a volume decrease of 3.3%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The increase in the first six months was primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.4% volume decline. The volume declines were primarily due to lower demand for chemicals, plastics and lumber, as well as lower shipments of petroleum products resulting from refinery outages. 38  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BNSF\n(Continued) Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 6.9% in the second quarter and an increase of 0.8% in the first six months compared to 2022. The second quarter revenue change was attributable to an 8.3% decline in volume, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The revenue increase in the first six months was primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 4.9%. The volume decreases were mainly due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $936 million in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 6.3% in the second quarter and an increase of 4.1% in the first six months versus 2022. The revenue decline in the second quarter was attributable to lower volumes of 3.5% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The revenue increase in the first six months was driven by higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 4.0%. The volume decreases derived from moderating demand attributable to lower natural gas prices and weather related impacts. Railroad operating expenses were $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $7.9 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of $186 million (4.6%) in the second quarter and an increase of $106 million (1.4%) in the first six months compared to 2022. The decline in the second quarter of 2023 reflected lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses and general inflation. The increase during the first six months of 2023 reflected increases in all operating expenses, with the exception of fuel costs and purchased services. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 68.2% in the second quarter and 4.4 percentage points to 68.3% in the first six months of 2023 versus the comparable 2022 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $165 million (13.6%) in the second quarter and $254 million (10.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased headcount, wage inflation and lower productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $443 million (34.7%) in the second quarter and $340 million (15.9%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes, as well as improved efficiency. Depreciation expense increased $32 million (5.2%) in the second quarter and $53 million (4.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher capital expenditures. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $80 million (17.4%) in the second quarter and $147 million (14.9%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to general inflation, increased casualty and litigation costs, higher property and other taxes and lower gains from land and easement sales. BHE We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d), a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments and an unregulated retail energy services company. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. 39  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE\n(Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval.

After-tax earnings increased $50 million (13.2%) in the second quarter and declined $187 million (24.0%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase for the second quarter was primarily attributable to higher interest and other income, lower depreciation and amortization expense and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by increases in operations and maintenance expense and interest expense. The earnings decrease in the first six months reflected an increase in operations and maintenance expense of $519 million, including a pre-tax increase in loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, of $344 million associated with the 2020 wildfires, and an increase in interest expense. These items were partially offset by increases in interest and other income, lower depreciation and amortization expense and higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), as well as higher income tax benefits. The U.S. utilities\u2019 electric utility margin was $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2023, relatively unchanged from 2022. Electric utility margin was $3.5 billion in the first six months of 2023, an increase of $60 million (1.7%) versus 2022. The year-to-date increase reflected a variety of changes in operating revenues attributable to rates and volumes and in power generation and purchased costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.1% (up 0.6% at PacifiCorp and 1.3% at MEC and down 1.7% at NV Energy) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in customer usage and in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather at MEC and NV Energy. 40  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE\n(Continued) After-tax earnings of natural gas pipelines decreased $12 million (6.0%) in the second quarter and increased $35 million (6.7%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in earnings for the first six months reflected higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases and favorable interest and other income, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses and the impact of state income tax reductions in the second quarter of 2022. After-tax earnings of other energy businesses decreased $22 million (5.4%) in the second quarter and $178 million (23.7%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines in earnings reflected lower earnings from renewable energy and retail services businesses, primarily attributable to lower income tax benefits and higher operating expenses and the impact of unfavorable changes in valuations of derivatives contracts, partially offset by debt extinguishment gains. Earnings in the first six months of 2023 also included a deferred income tax charge of $82 million recognized in the first quarter related to the enactment of the new Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom. After-tax earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $50 million in the second quarter and $105 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The decreases reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 26% year-to-date reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 38% year-to-date decrease in closed transaction volumes. These declines were attributable to the impact of rising interest rates, including lower existing home sales and mortgage refinancing demand. Corporate interest and other after-tax losses decreased $16 million in the second quarter and $12 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher other income, partially offset by lower federal income tax credits recognized and higher BHE corporate interest expense from an April 2022 debt issuance. Pilot Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across the U.S. and in six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. A substantial portion of Pilot\u2019s revenues and earnings derive from marketing fuel on a wholesale and retail basis and from other energy-related activities. Through January 31, 2023, we owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot, which we accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of Pilot\u2019s net earnings for the month ending January 31, 2023 and first six months of 2022 are included in equity method earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot, and we currently own an 80% controlling interest. Thus, we began consolidating Pilot\u2019s results of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on February 1, 2023. Pilot\u2019s earnings for the second quarter of 2023 and the five months ending June 30, 2023 are summarized below (in millions).

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Pilot\n(Continued) Pilot\u2019s revenues and earnings are highly dependent on fuel volumes, prices and margins. Revenues for the second quarter of 2023 and the five months ending June 30, 2023 were $14.8 billion and $24.3 billion, respectively. Pilot\u2019s pre-tax earnings for the second quarter of 2023 and the five months ending June 30, 2023 were $186 million and $322 million, respectively. Operating and other expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of $243 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $411 million in the five months ending June 30, 2023, a significant portion of which derives from property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible asset fair value remeasurements in connection with our application of the acquisition accounting method in 2023. Pilot\u2019s consolidated pre-tax earnings for the second quarter and the first six months of 2023 and 2022 are summarized below. Revenues, costs and expenses for the first six months of 2022 and first month of 2023 are based on Pilot\u2019s historical accounting and are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, whereas such information for the five months ending June 30, 2023 was included in our Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions).

For the first six months of 2023, Pilot sold approximately 9.25 billion gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and other fuel-related products. Revenues during the first six months of 2023 have been lower than in the corresponding 2022 periods, primarily due to significantly lower fuel prices, as well as from lower fuel sales volumes. Cost of sales in 2022 included significantly higher LIFO inventory charges than in 2023, attributable to the significant increases in fuel prices during the first half of 2022. Interest expense increased $62 million in the second quarter and $115 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, due to higher interest rates.

The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $174 million in the second quarter and $352 million in the first six months of 2023 and $162 million in the second quarter and $323 million in the first six months of 2022. These expenses are included in \u201cOther\u201d in the summary of earnings on page 31 and in the \u201cOther\u201d earnings section on page 48. 42  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months   2023   2022   2023   2022  Revenues            Industrial products $ 8,876   $ 7,714   $ 17,739   $ 15,189  Building products  6,693    7,710    12,703    14,422  Consumer products  3,533    4,348    6,949    8,582   $ 19,102   $ 19,772   $ 37,391   $ 38,193  Pre-tax earnings            Industrial products $ 1,520   $ 1,270   $ 2,961   $ 2,486  Building products  1,227    1,307    2,122    2,451  Consumer products  356    451    631    915   $ 3,103   $ 3,028   $ 5,714   $ 5,852  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues            Industrial products  17.1 %   16.5 %   16.7 %   16.4 % Building products  18.3 %   17.0 %   16.7 %   17.0 % Consumer products  10.1 %   10.4 %   9.1 %   10.7 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group also includes certain of Alleghany\u2019s businesses consisting of W&W|AFCO Steel, a structural steel fabrication products business, as well as other businesses that were combined into Marmon. Revenues of the industrial products group increased $1.2 billion (15.1%) in the second quarter and $2.6 billion (16.8%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings increased $250 million (19.7%) in the second quarter and $475 million (19.1%) in the first six months of 2023. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.7% for the first six months of 2023, an increase of 0.3% compared to the first six months of 2022. Operating results of the group in the first six months of 2023 reflected the impact of business acquisitions and overall improved operating results at our pre-existing businesses. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. PCC\u2019s revenues were $2.3 billion in the second quarter and $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2023, increases of 28.7% in the second quarter and 28.4% in the first six months compared to 2022. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2023 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increases. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 31.5% in the second quarter and 27.3% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The improved results in 2023 reflect the increases in sales and improving manufacturing and operating efficiencies. We continue to strive to improve manufacturing efficiencies, maintain safety and prepare for increasing demand for PCC\u2019s products. Continued growth in PCC\u2019s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products demand. Lubrizol\u2019s revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 5.5% in the second quarter and unchanged in the first six months compared to 2022. Revenues in the first six months of 2023 reflected lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar, offset by higher average selling prices. Lower sales volumes in 2023 were attributable to general market weakness in the global economy, resulting in lower demand in certain product lines. Sales volumes through the first half of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol\u2019s production capabilities. 43  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings declined 24.6% in the second quarter and 2.8% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 reflect lower insurance recoveries ($89 million) in connection with fires at certain production facilities in 2021 and 2020. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings were higher due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices and changes in product mix, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher raw material costs (primarily in the first quarter), higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Marmon\u2019s revenues were $3.1 billion in the second quarter and $6.2 billion in the first six months of 2023, increases of 12.2% in the second quarter and 14.3% in the first six months compared to 2022. Business acquisitions, including AP Emissions Technologies and three former Alleghany businesses: Kentucky Trailer, Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc. and Wilbert Plastics Services, accounted for $301 million and $595 million of comparative revenue increases in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively. In addition, the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services groups generated higher revenues in 2023, due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. The Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration group revenues in 2023 were negatively impacted by lower steel and copper prices. Marmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 30.6% in the second quarter and 21.8% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings increases attributable to business acquisitions were $26 million in the second quarter and $42 million in the first six months of 2023. Earnings in the second quarter of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown of its business in Russia. Otherwise, comparative earnings from Marmon\u2019s other business groups in 2023 were mixed, reflecting earnings increases in the Transportation, Water Technologies, and Crane Services groups, which were primarily attributable to revenue growth, and lower earnings in the Electrical group, driven by lower margins in the building wire business. IMC\u2019s revenues were $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, increases of 10.2% in the second quarter and 7.7% in the first six months compared to 2022. The revenue increases in 2023 reflect increased organic sales in North America, the impact of business acquisitions and higher interest income, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 15.1% in the second quarter and 9.0% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. In 2023, the impact of revenue increases was partially offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the adverse effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group decreased $1.0 billion (13.2%) in the second quarter and $1.7 billion (11.9%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings decreased $80 million (6.1%) in the second quarter and $329 million (13.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Our building products businesses have benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment and strong residential and commercial construction markets. The effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. over the past year has slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses. Such effects have been partially mitigated by new construction activity, resulting from low supplies of pre-existing homes for sale. We continue to anticipate some of our businesses will experience comparative declines in revenues and earnings over the remainder of 2023. Clayton Homes\u2019 revenues declined 16.3% to $2.9 billion in the second quarter and 13.8% to $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $971 million (19.0%) in the first six months of 2023, reflecting lower unit sales, partially offset by slightly higher average selling prices. New home unit sales declined 19.5% in the first six months of 2023, reflecting lower unit sales for factory-built homes (19.2%) and site-built homes (21.1%). We expect unit sales over the remainder of 2023 to be below 2022 levels. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 9.9% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased interest income on higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $22.5 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 12.4% since June 30, 2022. 44  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Building products (Continued) Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes declined $72 million (11.5%) in the second quarter and $150 million (13.5%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from the home building businesses. Earnings from financial services also declined in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, which were negatively affected by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims, partially offset by higher net interest income. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $7.3 billion in the first six months of 2023, decreases of $459 million (10.7%) in the second quarter and $860 million (10.5%) in the first six months versus 2022. Comparative revenues were lower at all of our other building products businesses, generally due to lower sales volumes and changes in product mix, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses declined slightly (1.2%) in the second quarter and $179 million (13.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter increased 1.7 percentage points and in the first six months of 2023 decreased 0.5 percentage points versus 2022. The earnings of our other building products businesses in 2023 were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies and benefited from lower average prices for certain raw materials and energy, as well as reduced freight and shipping expenses. The earnings in 2022 benefited from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories and an increase in the gains from a business divestiture and asset sales of $111 million. Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (Jazwares), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Consumer products group revenues decreased $815 million (18.7%) in the second quarter and $1.6 billion (19.0%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines reflected lower revenues at Forest River and nearly all of our other consumer products operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, which contributed revenues of $378 million in the first six months of 2023. Forest River\u2019s revenues declined 34.2% in the second quarter and 36.4% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an overall 40.1% decline in unit sales in the first six months and changes in sales mix. Forest River experienced strong recreational vehicle unit sales in recent years and through the first half of 2022. Since then, volumes have declined significantly, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. The sales volume declines for recreational vehicles in 2023 were partially offset by increased bus and commercial business. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $155 million (12.8%) in the second quarter and $222 million (9.2%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from apparel for the first six months of 2023 declined 13.5% from 2022, while revenues from footwear declined 1.8%. The decline in apparel revenue was attributable to continuing sluggish customer demand, partially offset by higher average selling prices and sales mix changes. Duracell\u2019s revenues in first six months of 2023 declined 7.8% versus 2022, primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $95 million (21.1%) in the second quarter and $284 million (31.0%) in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from Forest River and Duracell. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group decreased 1.6 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings from Forest River declined 39.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the decrease in unit sales, which reduced manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Apparel and footwear earnings declined 10.7% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Our apparel businesses were negatively affected by lower sales volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies. Earnings from Duracell declined in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, due to reduced consumer consumption and market share losses in North America to lower priced brands and to the non-recurring cost and expense reductions in the second quarter of 2022. 45  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months   2023  2022   2023  2022  Revenues          Service $ 5,181  $ 4,737   $ 10,500  $ 9,260  Retailing  4,960   4,880    9,572   9,472  McLane  12,883   13,262    25,942   25,777   $ 23,024  $ 22,879   $ 46,014  $ 44,509  Pre-tax earnings          Service $ 824  $ 756   $ 1,661  $ 1,480  Retailing  438   443    822   854  McLane  129   76    242   158   $ 1,391  $ 1,275   $ 2,725  $ 2,492  Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues          Service  15.9 %  16.0 %   15.8 %  16.0 % Retailing  8.8 %  9.1 %   8.6 %  9.0 % McLane  1.0 %  0.6 %   0.9 %  0.6 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training services and products to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS-Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management. Service group revenues increased $444 million (9.4%) in the second quarter and $1.2 billion (13.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. IPS had revenues of $302 million in the second quarter and $604 million in the first six months of 2023. Revenues from aviation services increased 8.2% in the second quarter and 13.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increases were primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and in-flight hours across NetJets\u2019 various programs, as well as higher average rates. Revenues from TTI declined 1.0% in the second quarter and increased 2.4% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 and the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, year-to-date revenues increased 1.0% in 2023 versus 2022. TTI experienced significant revenue growth in 2021 and much of 2022. Since the third quarter of 2022, new orders have slowed in several regions and markets, in part attributable to elevated customer inventory levels. These conditions are expected to continue and TTI may experience comparative revenue declines over the remainder of 2023. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $68 million (9.0%) in the second quarter and $181 million (12.2%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues declined 0.2 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increases were primarily attributable to higher overall margin rates in aviation services businesses, primarily due to a 17% year-to-date increase in average aircraft in the NetJets programs, changes in business mix and the impact of the IPS acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from TTI (6.4% year-to-date), attributable to lower gross margin rates, higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 67.6% of our combined retailing revenue in the first six months of 2023. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 18.3% of the combined retailing revenues in the first six months of 2023. 46  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\n(Continued) Retailing (Continued) Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailers (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionery products), Pampered Chef (high-quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues increased 1.6% in the second quarter and 1.1% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting increases at BHA, partially offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA\u2019s revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 increased 5.3% and 4.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 12.8% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 while revenues from pre-owned vehicle retail sales declined 8.4%. Unit sales in the first six months of 2023 increased 1.5%, reflecting an 8.9% increase in new vehicle sales, partly offset by lower pre-owned vehicles sold. While new vehicle inventory levels remain well below historical levels, vehicle supply continues to gradually rise. Revenues from BHA\u2019s parts/service/repair operations in the first six months of 2023 increased 8.8% versus 2022. Other retailing revenues in the aggregate declined 5.4% in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to lower sales at our home furnishings businesses. Retailing group pre-tax earnings declined $5 million (1.1%) in the second quarter and $32 million (3.7%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 12.7% in the second quarter and 21.1% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA\u2019s earnings increase reflects higher earnings from parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle sales margins and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA\u2019s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates, before the effects of LIFO, peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since been reverting to historical levels. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $36 million (18.2%) in the second quarter and $127 million (31.8%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 33.8% decrease in the first six months earnings from the home furnishings businesses, and the impact of a gain in the first quarter of 2022 related to the divestiture of certain jewelry stores. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice distribution businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins and operate in a highly competitive environment. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane\u2019s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues declined 2.9% in the second quarter and increased 0.6% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues in 2023 of the grocery and the foodservice businesses were negatively affected by lower unit volumes. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in the first six months of 2023, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. Pre-tax earnings increased $53 million (69.7%) in the second quarter and $84 million (53.2%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases in earnings reflects increases in the gross margin rates and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum, Pilot (through January 31, 2023) and Berkadia. After-tax earnings attributable to these businesses increased $353 million in the second quarter and $639 million in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to earnings from Occidental Petroleum and increases in earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz. We adopted the equity method of accounting for our investment in Occidental Petroleum common stock as of August 4, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in Pilot. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 on our pre-existing 38.6% interest and began consolidating Pilot\u2019s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. See Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 47  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions).   Second Quarter   First Six Months    2023   2022   2023   2022  Investment gains (losses)  $ 33,061   $ (66,854 )  $ 67,819   $ (68,589 ) Derivative contract gains (losses)   \u2014    (65 )   \u2014    (308 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   33,061    (66,919 )   67,819    (68,897 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   7,192    (13,881 )   14,511    (14,279 ) Net earnings (loss)  $ 25,869   $ (53,038 )  $ 53,308   $ (54,618 ) Effective income tax rate   21.7 %   21.0 %   21.3 %   20.8 % Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in equity securities of non-U.S. issuers held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized gains of $33.0 billion in the second quarter and $63.8 billion in the first six months of 2023 and net unrealized losses of $66.9 billion in the second quarter and $68.5 billion in the first six months of 2022 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold generally represents the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $2.4 billion in the second quarter and $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to taxable gains of $76 million in the second quarter and losses of $663 million in the first six months of 2022. Pre-tax investment gains in the first six months of 2023 included a non-cash gain of approximately $3 billion related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing interest in Pilot to fair value through the application of acquisition accounting upon attaining control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes on January 31. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We also continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).

Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains pertain to Berkshire\u2019s and BHFC\u2019s Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2023 and 2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. 48  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Our Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity at June 30, 2023 was $539.9 billion, an increase of $66.5 billion since December 31, 2022. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $71.4 billion in the first six months of 2023, which included after-tax gains on our investments of $53.3 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $5.8 billion in the first six months of 2023 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At June 30, 2023, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $141.9 billion, which included $120.4 billion invested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $375.8 billion. During the first six months of 2023, we paid cash of $7.4 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $25.8 billion from sales of equity securities. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion. Our consolidated borrowings at June 30, 2023 were $125.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF, BHE and its subsidiaries and Pilot. During the first six months of 2023, we issued new term debt of approximately $4.0 billion and repaid $7.6 billion on maturing term debt. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at June 30, 2023 was $17.7 billion, a decrease of $3.7 billion since December 31, 2022. Berkshire repaid $4.3 billion of maturing debt in the first six months of 2023. In April 2023, Berkshire issued \u00a5164.4 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) of senior notes. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $18.0 billion at June 30, 2023, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2022. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $24.3 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $854 million from December 31, 2022. In June 2023, BNSF issued $1.6 billion of 5.2% debentures due in 2054. During the first six months of 2023, BNSF repaid approximately $700 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.9 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2022. In May 2023, a BHE subsidiary issued $1.2 billion of 5.5% first mortgage bonds due in 2054. During the first six months of 2023, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid approximately $1.4 billion of term debt. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $4.5 billion. Borrowings of Pilot were $5.9 billion as of the January 31, 2023 acquisition date and were $5.8 billion at June 30, 2023. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt or other borrowings issued by BNSF, BHE, Pilot or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. In the first six months of 2023, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $21.1 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $8.4 billion in the first six months of 2023, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $5.7 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2023 will approximate $8.3 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cthe 2022 act\u201d) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on \u201cadjusted financial statement income\u201d, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax addressing certain, but not all, issues that need clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury may release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect that compliance with the provisions of the 2022 act will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 49  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition\n(Continued) On July 10, 2023, BHE announced that it had executed an agreement to acquire an additional 50% interest in Cove Point LNG, LP, which would increase its ownership interest to 75%. The transaction is valued at $3.3 billion and is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. BHE expects to fund the acquisition with cash on hand. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $143.5 billion at June 30, 2023. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of June 30, 2023, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2023 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 includes estimated liabilities of $143.5 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 included goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $85.9 billion, which included $10.6 billion of goodwill associated with the Alleghany and Pilot acquisitions, and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $20.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. 50  Item 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies\n(Continued) Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of June 30, 2023, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and general changes in business conditions, as well as other unanticipated events, on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units are inherently subjective and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit\u2019s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 51  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati\nve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in particular the \u201cMarket Risk Disclosures\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As of June 30, 2023, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire\u2019s Annual Report. Item 4. Controls\nand Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other\nInformation Item 1. Legal\nProceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris\nk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 52  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o\nf Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire\u2019s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2023 follows.
