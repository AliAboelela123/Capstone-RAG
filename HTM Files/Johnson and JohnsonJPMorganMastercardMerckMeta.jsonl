March2020 and updated January 2021 | \u2022Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and other transactions are amended due to reference rate reform.\u2022Provides an election to account for certain contract amendments related to reference rate reform as modifications rather than extinguishments without the requirement to assess the significance of the amendments.\u2022Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge accounting relationship without automatic termination of that relationship. Provides various practical expedients and elections designed to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted during the transition period.\u2022Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met.\u2022The January 2021 update provides an election to account for derivatives modified to change the rate used for discounting, margining, or contract price alignment (collectively \u201cdiscounting transition\u201d) as modifications. |  | \u2022Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 2021 update was effective when issued.\u2022The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships, and discounting transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting transition election was applied retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted\nStandard | Summary of guidance |  | Effects on financial statements\nDerivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer MethodIssued March 2022 | \u2022Expands the current ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged.\u2022Clarifies the types of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and updates the disclosure guidance for the hedge accounting adjustments. |  | \u2022Required effective date: January 1, 2023.(a)\u2022The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Firm's planned date of adoption.\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage DisclosuresIssued March 2022 | \u2022Eliminates existing accounting and disclosure requirements for Troubled Debt Restructurings, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow methodology.\u2022Requires disclosure of loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty involving principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications.\u2022Requires disclosure of current period loan charge-off information byorigination year.\u2022May be adopted prospectively, or by using a modified retrospective method wherein the effect of adoption is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings at the effective date. |  | \u2022Required effective date: January 1, 2023.(a)\u2022The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u2022The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on
