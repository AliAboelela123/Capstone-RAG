management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and

accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash
equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit
quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S.
and internationally. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due
to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many
different industries and geographies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers&#146;
financial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in
certain circumstances.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sell our products through our direct sales force and distributors. No customer accounted
for 10% or more of our net accounts receivable balance at October&nbsp;31, 2010 and one customer
accounted for 11% of our net accounts receivable balance at July&nbsp;31, 2011. For both the quarter and
nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, no single customer represented 10% or more of net revenue. For the
quarter and nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, no single customer and one customer, respectively,

technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns. Our financial

economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the guidance issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, on the milestone method of revenue recognition became effective. The new
guidance recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition method for
substantive milestones in research or development transactions. A milestone is substantive when the
consideration earned from achievement of the milestone is commensurate with either (a)&nbsp;the vendor&#146;s
performance to achieve the milestone or (b)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s)
as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone
and the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone relates solely to past performance
and is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential
milestone considerations) within the arrangement. The guidance may be applied retrospectively to
all arrangements or prospectively to milestones achieved after the effective date. The adoption of
this guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial
position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we adopted the FASB&#146;s updated guidance that amends
the requirements for evaluating whether a decision maker or service provider has a variable
interest to clarify that a quantitative approach should not be the sole consideration in assessing
the criteria. It also clarifies that related parties should be considered in applying all of the
decision maker and service provider criteria. This is in addition to the authoritative guidance the
FASB issued in June&nbsp;2009 that applies to determining whether an entity is a variable interest
entity and requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s
variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
entity. This new guidance eliminates the exceptions to consolidating qualifying special-purpose
entities, contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, and increases the
frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity. The guidance also contains a new requirement that any term, transaction,
or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity&#146;s status as a variable interest
entity, a company&#146;s power over a variable interest entity, or a company&#146;s obligation to absorb
losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying the existing
provisions. The elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept and its consolidation
exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and
financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we adopted the guidance the FASB issued on revenue
recognition that addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables
contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated
among the separate units of accounting. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or
prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. The adoption of this guidance did not
have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we adopted the FASB guidance that modifies the scope
of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a)&nbsp;non-software components of tangible
products and (b)&nbsp;software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed or leased with
tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product
function together to deliver the tangible product&#146;s essential functionality. The guidance may be
applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. The adoption
of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial
position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. The new
guidance is intended to enhance comparability between entities that report under U.S. GAAP and
those that report under International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, and to provide a more
consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity&#146;s equity. In
accordance with the new guidance, an entity has the option to present the total comprehensive
income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements and
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the
statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity. This new guidance should be applied retrospectively
and will be effective for our second quarter of our fiscal year ending October&nbsp;28, 2012, or fiscal
year 2012, with early adoption permitted. Other than its impact on the presentation of other
comprehensive income, we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact
on our results of operations and financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2011, the FASB issued an updated guidance on fair value measurement and related
disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP, and the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB,
issued fair value measurement guidance (together, the new guidance). The new guidance amends U.S.
GAAP and is a new standard under IFRS. The new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair
value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP
and IFRS. While many of the amendments to U.S. GAAP are not expected to have a significant effect
on practice, the new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure
requirements. The new guidance will be effective for the second quarter of our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and
disclosures, which requires separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements
relating to Level 3 fair value measurements (see Note 6. &#147;Fair Value&#148; for further discussion of
fair value measurements). This guidance will be effective for our fiscal year 2012, and its interim
periods. Other than requiring additional disclosures in our financial statements, we believe the
adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our results of operations and
financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we acquired a U.S.-based company engaged in the
manufacturing of integrated circuits for approximately $8&nbsp;million in cash. The purchase price was
allocated to the acquired net assets based on estimates of fair values as follows: net assets of
$8&nbsp;million, including intangible assets of $4&nbsp;million and goodwill of $5&nbsp;million. The intangible
assets are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from 5 to 15&nbsp;years. The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired
business commencing as of the acquisition date. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition
have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition were not material to our prior
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended May&nbsp;1, 2011, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility.
There were no outstanding loan borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility at the time
of termination. This termination resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1&nbsp;million,
related to the write-off of debt amortization costs and other related expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the termination of our revolving credit facility, on March&nbsp;31, 2011, Avago
Technologies Finance Pte. Ltd., or Avago Finance, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company
entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The credit
agreement provides for a $200&nbsp;million unsecured, revolving credit facility. The credit agreement
has a term of four years. The credit agreement includes (i)&nbsp;financial covenants requiring Avago
Finance to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio; (ii)&nbsp;customary
restrictive covenants (subject, in each case, to certain exceptions and amounts) that limit Avago
Finance&#146;s ability to, among other things, create liens, merge or consolidate with and into other
persons, and sell assets; (iii)&nbsp;customary events of default, upon the occurrence of which, after
any applicable grace period, the lenders will have the ability to accelerate all outstanding loans
thereunder and terminate the commitments; and (iv)&nbsp;customary representations and warranties. In
addition, Avago Finance has the ability, at any time, to increase the aggregate commitments under
the credit agreement from $200&nbsp;million to $300&nbsp;million subject to the condition that no default or
event of default shall have occurred and be continuing and other terms and conditions set forth in
the credit agreement, and the receipt of sufficient commitments for such increase from the lenders.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company guarantee the revolving credit facility. The credit agreement
also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $40&nbsp;million in the aggregate, which
reduces the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar
basis. As of July&nbsp;31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under the new revolving credit
facility and were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement.

</DIV>


<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
A three level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3 measurements).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements
are described below:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1&#151;Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our
Level 1 assets include time deposits, bank acceptances, investment funds&#151;deferred compensation
plan assets and available-for-sale securities investments. We measure investment funds and
available-for-sale securities investments at quoted market price as they are traded in an active
market with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions. Time deposits are highly liquid with
maturities of ninety days or less. Bank acceptances are highly liquid with maturities of one
hundred and eighty days or less. Due to their short-term maturities, we have determined that the
fair value of time deposits and bank acceptances should be their face value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2010, we made a $1&nbsp;million common stock investment in a privately-held non-U.S.
company. Until July&nbsp;2011, this equity investment was accounted for under the cost method and
periodically reviewed for impairment. In July&nbsp;2011, upon the completion of the investee&#146;s initial
public offering on a non-U.S. stock exchange, its common stock became publicly traded and we
classified our investment as an available-for-sale security reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains, net of taxes, presented as a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity under the caption
&#147;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&#148;. This available-for-sale securities investment was
classified as a Level 1 asset as of July&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;8, 2011, the Company&#146;s board of directors, or the Board, authorized the repurchase of
up to 15&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s outstanding ordinary shares, not to exceed $500&nbsp;million, in the
aggregate, pursuant to the shareholder approval of the Company&#146;s 2011 share purchase mandate
received at the Company&#146;s 2011 Annual General Meeting on March&nbsp;30, 2011, or the 2011 Share Purchase
Mandate. Pursuant to the 2011 Share Purchase Mandate, the Company, upon authorization of the Board,
is authorized to repurchase up to approximately 24.6&nbsp;million ordinary shares (representing 10% of
the outstanding shares on the date of the 2011 Annual General Meeting), in open market transactions
or pursuant to equal access schemes, prior to the date on which the 2012 Annual General Meeting of
the Company is held or is required by law to be held. The Company may not repurchase more than 15
million of ordinary shares, or more than $500&nbsp;million, without further action by the Board. Share
repurchases will be made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as the Company deems
appropriate. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors
including price, market conditions and applicable legal requirements. The share repurchase program
does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or
terminated at any time without prior notice. All repurchased shares are immediately retired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company repurchased 1.9&nbsp;million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $68&nbsp;million in
cash, with a weighted average price per share of $36.02, during the quarter and nine months ended
July&nbsp;31, 2011. As of July&nbsp;31, 2011, $432&nbsp;million, or 13.1&nbsp;million shares remained available for
repurchase under this share repurchase program.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividend yield of zero for the quarter and nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010 is based on
the fact that we did not intend to pay cash dividends as of the respective option grant dates
during those periods. The dividend yield for the quarter and nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 is
based on the dividend yield as of the respective option grant dates. Expected volatility is based
on the combination of historical volatility of guideline publicly-traded companies over the period
commensurate with the expected life of the options and the implied volatility of guideline
publicly-traded companies from traded options with a term of 180&nbsp;days or greater measured over the
last three months. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the average U.S. Treasury Strips
rate during the period, which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant. Our computation
of expected term was based on data, such as the data of peer companies and company-specific
attributes that we believe could affect employees&#146; exercise behavior.

the share option plans for the quarters ended August&nbsp;1, 2010 and July&nbsp;31, 2011 were $8.61 and
$12.99, respectively, and $8.09 and $12.36 for the nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010 and July&nbsp;31,
2011, respectively. The first six month purchase period under our
ESPP began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The weighted-average fair values of the rights to purchase shares in the ESPP
for the quarter and nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 were $9.82 and $7.76, respectively. RSUs were
first granted in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended November&nbsp;1, 2010 and then in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2011. No RSUs were granted in the quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011. The
weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted under the 2009 Equity Incentive Award Plan for the nine
months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 was $32.39.

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP as of
July&nbsp;31, 2011 was not material, and is expected to be recognized over the remaining portion of the current offering
period under the ESPP, which ends on September&nbsp;14, 2011. Total compensation cost related to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASC 280 &#147;Segment Reporting,&#148; or ASC 280, establishes standards for the way public business
enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements
and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports. ASC 280 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers.
<!-- /xbrl,dnap -->
 We have concluded that we have one reportable
segment based on the following factors: sales of semiconductors represents our only material source
of revenue; substantially all products offered incorporate analog functionality and are
manufactured under similar manufacturing processes; we use an integrated approach in developing our
products in that discrete technologies developed are frequently integrated across many of our
products; we use a common order fulfillment process and similar distribution approach for our
products; and broad distributor networks are typically utilized while large accounts are serviced
by a direct sales force. The Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating
Decision Maker as defined by ASC 280.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no other substantial changes to our contractual commitments during the first nine
months of fiscal year 2011 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year
2010.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to
companies engaged in our line of business, including commercial disputes and employment issues. As
of the date of this filing, we are not involved in any pending legal proceedings that we believe
would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. However, certain pending disputes involve claims by third parties that our activities
infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights. These claims
generally involve the demand by a third party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the
allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or
royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property. For
example, on July&nbsp;23, 2009, TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., or TriQuint, filed a complaint against us
and certain of our subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court, District of Arizona seeking declaratory
judgment that four of our patents relating to RF filter technology used in our wireless products
are invalid and, if valid, that TriQuint&#146;s products do not infringe any of those patents. TriQuint
subsequently withdrew those claims with respect to three of those four patents. In addition,
TriQuint claims that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents. TriQuint is
seeking damages in an unspecified amount, treble damages for alleged willful infringement,
attorneys fees and injunctive relief. We filed our answer and initial counterclaim on September&nbsp;17,
2009, denying infringement, asserting the invalidity of TriQuint&#146;s patents and asserting
infringement by TriQuint of ten Avago patents and filed additional counterclaims on March&nbsp;25, 2010
for the misappropriation of Avago trade secrets. On October&nbsp;16, 2009, TriQuint filed its answer to
our initial counterclaim, denying infringement and filed an antitrust counterclaim and
counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. While the court
dismissed TriQuint&#146;s antitrust counterclaims on procedural grounds on March&nbsp;16, 2010, TriQuint
filed a motion to file an amended pleading for its antitrust claims, which was granted on August&nbsp;3,
2010. We intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously, and future actions may include the assertion by
us of additional claims or counterclaims against TriQuint related to our intellectual property
portfolio.

in the U.S District Court, Northern District of California, seeking a determination of whether
PixArt is licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products pursuant
to an existing cross-license agreement between us and PixArt, which license is limited to optical
mouse and optical mouse trackball products. We did not license to PixArt our patents for optical
finger navigation products. We intend to defend this action vigorously and to seek to have the
scope of the cross-license agreement properly construed by the court as excluding such products. We
also filed a counterclaim against PixArt on March&nbsp;31, 2010, asserting that PixArt has breached the
terms of the cross-license agreement between the parties. We are seeking a determination that
PixArt is not licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products,
damages in an unspecified amount, termination for breach, or rescission, of the license agreement
and attorneys fees.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2010 we filed a patent infringement action against ST Microelectronics NV, or ST
Microelectronics, in the Eastern District of Texas for infringement of four of our patents related
to optical navigation devices. We amended the complaint on July&nbsp;6, 2010 adding infringement of a
fifth optical navigation related patent to the action. We are seeking injunctive relief, damages in
an unspecified amount, treble damages for willful infringement and attorneys fees. In response, ST
Microelectronics filed a patent infringement action against us in the Northern District of Texas
alleging that our sales of certain optical navigation devices infringed two ST Microelectronics&#146;
patents. ST Microelectronics is seeking injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. ST
Microelectronics filed a second suit against us on November&nbsp;5, 2010 in the Northern District of
California alleging certain anticompetitive actions by us in the optical navigation sensor market.
ST Microelectronics is seeking injunctive and compensatory relief under the Sherman Act and the
Clayton Act and Attorneys fees. On January&nbsp;4, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss ST
Microelectronics&#146; claims relating to anticompetitive actions by us and on April&nbsp;11, 2011, the court
ordered a stay of this matter pending resolution of the patent litigation in the Eastern District
of Texas; on June&nbsp;17, 2011 ST Microelectronics filed a motion to

Corporation, or Cypress, for infringement of three of our patents related to optical navigation
devices. We are seeking injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount, treble damages for
willful infringement and expenses and attorneys fees. On May&nbsp;23, 2011, Cypress filed its answer and
counterclaim against us for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the
patents asserted by us. On August&nbsp;22, 2011, Cypress filed an amended answer and counterclaim
alleging infringement by us of five of Cypress&#146;s patents. In its counterclaim Cypress is seeking
injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount, treble damages for willful infringement and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, we have not yet been
able to determine whether an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible and have not
been able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. As a result, no amounts
have been accrued or disclosed in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements with respect to these legal proceedings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third-party intellectual
property rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers)
often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain.
Moreover, from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights.
Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex intellectual property
litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and
technical personnel.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Warranty</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we notified certain customers of a
product quality issue and began taking additional steps to correct the quality issue and work with
affected customers to determine potential costs covered by our warranty obligations. We maintain
insurance coverage for product liability and have been working with our insurance carriers to
determine the extent of covered losses in this situation. Based on settlements with customers to
date, the status of discussions with other affected customers and discussions with our insurance
carriers, we recorded a charge of $2&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 to cover
costs relating to this quality issue in excess of expected insurance coverage. We continue to have
discussions with affected customers and presently believe that amounts we have recorded in our
financial statements along with expected insurance coverage proceeds will be adequate to resolve
these claims, although this assessment is subject to change based on the ultimate resolution of
this matter with customers and the insurance carriers. In addition, if the timing of settlement of
claims with customers and the timing of determination of insurance recoveries do not occur in the
same reporting periods, there could be material increases in charges to the consolidated statement
of operations in a future period and decreases in a subsequent period once insurance recoveries are
deemed probable of realization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2009, we identified another product quality issue with a particular
component, took steps to correct the quality issue and notified our customers. Though the expected
failure rate of the product was not 100%, based on our quality tests, we have offered to replace
all such components used or still held by our customers. We recorded charges of $6&nbsp;million during
fiscal year 2009 related to this product quality issue, based on the progress of discussions with
our customers and our best estimate of our exposure related to this matter, which covered costs to
scrap inventory of such components held by us and costs associated with providing replacement parts
to customers. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded additional charges of $11&nbsp;million to cover
customer claims for reimbursements of costs incurred by such customers related to this product
quality issue and also during fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement agreements with certain
customers on this product quality issue. The final settlement amounts approximate the estimated
accrued warranty obligations for those customers. In addition, we made $2&nbsp;million of cash
settlement payments in connection with these agreements during fiscal year 2010, resulting in a $2
million decrease in the warranty accrual for this product quality issue during the same period.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2011, we reached additional final settlement agreements
with certain customers, made $2&nbsp;million of cash settlement payments and shipped $1&nbsp;million of
replacement parts in connection with these agreements, resulting in a $3&nbsp;million decrease in the
warranty accrual for this product quality issue during the period. In addition, following these
additional settlements, we reassessed our overall exposure relating to this product quality issue
based on the estimates of unknown and known claims, including our estimate of any
remaining replacement parts exposure, and reduced the warranty accrual we previously recorded by $4
million. We presently believe that amounts we have recorded in our financial statements will be
adequate to resolve any warranty obligations related to this issue, although this assessment is
subject to change based on the ultimate resolution of this matter with remaining customers.
However, we continue to have discussions with affected customers on the matter and although we have
made our best estimate of the expected warranty obligation based on available information, we could
record further charges in future periods based on the ultimate resolution of this matter with such
customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agilent has given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard Company in connection with its
activities prior to its spin-off from Hewlett-Packard Company in June&nbsp;1999 for the businesses that
constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. As the successor to the SPG business of Agilent, we have
acquired responsibility for indemnifications related to assigned intellectual property agreements.
Additionally, when we completed the acquisition of SPG from Agilent in December&nbsp;2005, we provided
indemnities to Agilent with regard to Agilent&#146;s conduct of the SPG business prior to the SPG
acquisition. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications is not material and no amount
has been accrued in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to
these indemnification obligations.

other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others
with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for
intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify
customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our
businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss,
expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our
products, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned
facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such
contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide
protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product
liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications
are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog
semiconductor devices with a focus on III-V based products. III-V semiconductor materials have
higher electrical conductivity and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio
frequency, or RF, and optoelectronic applications than silicon. We differentiate ourselves through
our high performance design and integration capabilities. We serve four primary target markets:
wireless communications, wired infrastructure, industrial and automotive electronics, and consumer
and computing peripherals. Applications for our products in these target markets include cellular
phones, consumer appliances, data networking and telecommunications equipment, enterprise storage
and servers, factory automation, displays, optical mice and printers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States, or GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and
various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and
the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual
results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical
accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and
involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue
recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory valuation
and warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes and share-based compensation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the quarter
and nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 compared to those previously disclosed in &#147;Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates&#148; in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Net revenue. </I>Net revenue was $603&nbsp;million for the quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, compared to
$550&nbsp;million for the quarter ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, an increase of $53&nbsp;million or 10%. Net revenue
was $1,713&nbsp;million for the nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, compared to $1,521&nbsp;million for the nine
months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, an increase of $192&nbsp;million or 13%. Net revenue increased primarily
due to strength in the wired infrastructure target market and a broad-based increase in demand for
our products in our three largest target markets in the quarter and nine months ended July&nbsp;31,
2011. The increase in net revenue for the nine months ended
July&nbsp;31, 2011 was also due to improved
general economic conditions during that period, compared to the corresponding periods in 2010.
However, uncertainty with regard to the direction of the global economy has returned in recent
months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our three largest target markets, by revenue, are wireless communications, industrial and
automotive electronics and wired infrastructure, with computer and consumer computing peripherals
typically representing a much smaller percentage of our overall net revenue. The percentage of
total net revenue generated by sales into each of our target markets varies from quarter to
quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality.
The first fiscal quarter is typically our lowest revenue and cash generating quarter due, in part,
to holiday shut downs at many original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers and distributors,
and the first half of the fiscal year tends to generate lower revenue than the second half. We saw
a return to this typical seasonality during the first half of fiscal year 2011. However, we may
not see typical seasonality during the remaining portion of our fiscal year due to customer
concerns regarding global economic conditions. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, a
devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan, a critical area for manufacturing many
components important for the semiconductor supply chain. These events did not have a significant
effect on our own business in the second fiscal quarter. However, we believe that they may have
caused semiconductor suppliers, manufacturers and customers to build up inventory in the aftermath
of these events, in anticipation of component shortages. We believe this may be causing inventory
corrections in the supply chain.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenue from our wireless communications target market increased, in absolute dollars, in
both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 compared with the
corresponding prior year periods due to continued strength in mobile smart phone sales. The growth
of key platforms in next-generation smart phones at leading new and existing OEM customers, which
incorporate many of our proprietary products such as 3G radio frequency front-end devices drove
revenue growth during the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. In addition, the launch of new
long term evolution, or LTE, and worldwide interoperability for microwave access, or WiMax smart
phones in North America also contributed to revenue growth in the quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011. The
slight decrease in net revenue as a percentage of net revenue for both the third quarter and the
first nine months of fiscal year 2011 compared with the corresponding prior year periods was due,
primarily, to the strength in our wired infrastructure products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenue from our industrial and automotive electronics target market increased, in
absolute dollars, in both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2011 compared with
the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 was
in large part due to the improved general economic conditions during the first half of fiscal year
2011, compared with the same period in fiscal year 2010. During the quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011
continued strength in demand in Japan and China was accompanied by some softening of demand in
North America and Europe, which we believe may have been caused by a worsening economic outlook.
However, for both the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 demand in this
target market was broad based, with particular strength in sales of optocouplers, industrial fiber
optic transceivers and motion encoders. We also continued to benefit from increased customer
spending on and new and increased uses for our devices in applications such as inverters, servo
machine tools, factory automation and infrastructure applications including renewable energy, smart
power grid installations and transportation, in both developed economies and in emerging economies
such as China.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenue from our wired infrastructure target market increased substantially, in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of net revenue, in both the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2011, compared with the corresponding prior year periods, as spending on enterprise
networking data centers, storage systems and core routing improved. We also introduced a number of
new fiber optic transceivers and designed new ASICs in the first nine months of fiscal year 2011,
compared with the corresponding prior year period, which also contributed to the increase in
revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we saw strong growth from sales of our ASIC
products compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, due to strength in next-generation data
center switching. In addition, we also benefited from a large sale of our proprietary parallel
optical transceivers for a core routing infrastructure project in China during the quarter ended
July&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenue from our consumer and computing peripheral target market decreased, in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of net revenue, in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal
year 2011 compared with the corresponding periods in 2010. This reflected
a decline in sales of optical sensors used in optical mice and sales of motion encoders used
in applications such as optical disc drives and printers in the third quarter and first nine months
of fiscal year 2011. Net revenue from this target market during these periods was also affected by
ongoing softness in the personal computer and printer market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Gross margin. </I>Gross margin was $297&nbsp;million for the quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 compared to
$263&nbsp;million for the quarter ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, an increase of $34&nbsp;million or 13%. As a
percentage of net revenue, gross margin increased slightly to 49% for the quarter ended July&nbsp;31,
2011 from 48% for the quarter ended August&nbsp;1, 2010. Gross margin was $843&nbsp;million for the nine
months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 compared to $690&nbsp;million for the nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, an
increase of $153&nbsp;million or 22%. As a percentage of net revenue, gross margin increased to 49% for
the nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 from 45% for the nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010. The increase
in gross margin percentage was attributable to improvements in product mix. During the quarter
ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 as compared to the quarter ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, overall gross margin benefited
from both improved margin and growth in sales in our wired infrastructure target market. During the
nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, compared to the nine months

proportion of our net revenue was from products sold into the industrial and automotive electronics
target market and from sales of our proprietary products in our wireless communications and wired
infrastructure target markets, both of which generally earn higher margins than our other products. During
the nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, we also released warranty accruals in an aggregate amount of
$5&nbsp;million arising from our assessment of the remaining exposure for certain product quality
issues.

$14&nbsp;million or 20%. The majority of this increase resulted from investments in our wired
infrastructure and wireless communications solutions. As a percentage of net revenue, research and
development expenses increased slightly to 14% for the quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, compared to 13%
for the quarter ended August&nbsp;1, 2010. The increase in absolute dollars was attributable to $4
million increase in salary and employee benefits expense related to increase in headcount and our
annual salary review cycle, $4&nbsp;million increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to
higher operating profit and design wins, $3&nbsp;million increase in research and development project
consumables and test hardware, $2&nbsp;million increase in share based compensation expense attributable
to grants of share based awards at higher fair market values and to our Employee Share Purchase
Plan, or ESPP, and $1&nbsp;million increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures

million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes. The redemption of the senior
subordinated notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $19&nbsp;million. During the nine
months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, we replaced our existing revolving credit facility with a new revolving
credit facility. This resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1&nbsp;million, primarily
related to the write-off of debt amortization costs. During the nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010,
we redeemed $318&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of our senior fixed rate notes and the
remaining $46&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of our senior floating rate notes. The redemption
of the senior fixed rate notes and senior floating rate notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment

the quarter and nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, respectively, compared to $4&nbsp;million and $17
million for the quarter and nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010, respectively. The tax expense for the
quarter ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 included a benefit of $3&nbsp;million due to a change in estimate on
realizability of certain U.S. tax credit carryforwards, and the tax expense for the nine months
ended July&nbsp;31, 2011 also included a benefit of $3&nbsp;million from U.S. legislation enacted in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2011 retroactively reinstating the research and development tax
credit. The provision for the nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010 included a $6&nbsp;million charge to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales are generally made pursuant to short-term purchase orders. These purchase orders are
made without deposits and may be rescheduled, canceled or modified on relatively short notice, and
in most cases without substantial penalty. Therefore, we believe that purchase orders or backlog
are not a reliable indicator of future sales.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are affected by seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries. We typically
experience sequentially lower revenues in the first fiscal half of the year. Our revenue in the
second half of the fiscal year is typically higher than our revenue in the first half of the fiscal
year due to seasonality in two of our target markets, consumer and computing peripherals and
wireless communications. These target markets typically experience seasonality due to the &#147;back to
school&#148; and calendar year-end holiday selling seasons. However,
concerns about global economic conditions may mute typical seasonal
effects for the remainder of our fiscal year 2011.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary sources of liquidity as at July&nbsp;31, 2011 consisted of: (1)&nbsp;approximately $704
million in cash and cash equivalents, (2)&nbsp;cash we expect to generate from operations and (3)&nbsp;our
$200&nbsp;million revolving credit facility, which is committed until March&nbsp;31, 2015, all of which is
available to be drawn.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i)&nbsp;working capital
requirements and (ii)&nbsp;research and development and capital expenditure needs, including
acquisitions from time to time. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future
cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance and are, therefore, subject to
prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which
are beyond our control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or finance growth
opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our financial
condition and our business could suffer. We may seek to obtain debt or equity financing in the
future. However, we cannot assure that such additional financing will be available on terms
acceptable to us or at all.
Our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur, under our revolving credit facility, or
otherwise, will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15&nbsp;million of the
Company&#146;s outstanding ordinary shares, not to exceed $500&nbsp;million, in the aggregate, in open market
transactions prior to the date on which the 2012 Annual General Meeting of the Company is held or
is required by law to be held. During the quarter and nine months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011, we
repurchased 1.9&nbsp;million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $68&nbsp;million, pursuant to this
authorization.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 will be higher than for
fiscal year 2010 due to spending on mask sets for new ASIC designs and capacity expansion in both
our Fort Collins, Colorado and Singapore internal fabrication facilities. We believe that our cash

from share-based compensation and $6&nbsp;million of debt issuance costs written off in connection with
our debt redemption in December&nbsp;2010. Net income was also reduced by $14&nbsp;million for the premium
paid on our debt redemption which is included in the $20&nbsp;million loss on extinguishment of debt in
the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable remained flat at $285&nbsp;million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal
year 2011 compared to the end of fiscal year 2010. The number of days sales outstanding decreased
to 43&nbsp;days at July&nbsp;31, 2011 from 45&nbsp;days at October&nbsp;31, 2010 due to improved linearity of revenue.
We use the current quarter revenue and accounts receivable at quarter end in our calculation of
number of days sales outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory increased to $200&nbsp;million at July&nbsp;31, 2011 from $189&nbsp;million at the end of fiscal
year 2010 due to an increase in anticipated demand. However, the number of days of inventory on
hand increased only slightly to 62&nbsp;days at July&nbsp;31, 2011 compared to 61&nbsp;days at October&nbsp;31, 2010.
We use the current quarter cost of products sold and inventory at quarter end in our calculation of
days on hand of inventory.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current liabilities decreased to $311&nbsp;million at July&nbsp;31, 2011 from $565&nbsp;million at the end of
fiscal year 2010, mainly due to the redemption in December&nbsp;2010 of $230&nbsp;million of long-term debt
that was classified as current at October&nbsp;31, 2010 (as it had been irrevocably called for
redemption before the fiscal year end) and decreases in accrued interest and other current
liabilities, offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits accruals. Accrued interest
decreased to less than $1&nbsp;million at July&nbsp;31, 2011 from $12&nbsp;million at the end of fiscal year 2010
mainly due to the debt redemption and semi-annual interest payments made during the first nine
months of fiscal year 2011. Other current liabilities decreased from $41&nbsp;million at the end of
fiscal year 2010 to $25&nbsp;million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 primarily due
to an $8&nbsp;million decrease in accrued warranty related to settlement payments and
reassessment of replacement parts exposure and an $8&nbsp;million decrease in current income tax
payable. Employee compensation and benefits increased to $88&nbsp;million from $82&nbsp;million at fiscal
year 2010 mainly due to merit increases in salary, partially offset by payments made under our employee bonus
plan in respect of fiscal year 2010 performance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended August&nbsp;1, 2010 was $293
million. The net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to net income of $251
million and non-cash charges of $146&nbsp;million, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities
of $104&nbsp;million. The non-cash charges of $146&nbsp;million included $119&nbsp;million for depreciation and
amortization, $18&nbsp;million of share-based compensation and $8&nbsp;million of debt issuance costs written
off in connection with our debt redemption. Net income was also reduced by $16&nbsp;million for the
premium paid on our debt redemption which is included in the $24&nbsp;million loss on extinguishment of
debt in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

long-term debt that was classified as current at November&nbsp;1, 2009 (as it had been irrevocably
called for redemption before the fiscal year end) and decreases in accrued interest. This decrease
was offset by an increase in accounts payable and employee compensation and benefits. Accrued
interest decreased $20&nbsp;million or 80% from fiscal year 2009 mainly due to the debt redemption and
semi-annual interest payments made during the first nine months of fiscal year 2010. Accounts
payable increased to $172&nbsp;million from $154&nbsp;million at the end of fiscal year 2009 mainly due to
timing of disbursements and higher volume of purchases related to increase in revenue. Employee
compensation and benefits increased to $69&nbsp;million from $55&nbsp;million at fiscal year 2009 mainly due
to our employee bonus program related to our overall profitability.

million to repurchase and cancel 1.9&nbsp;million shares of our ordinary shares under our share

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to
companies engaged in our line of business, including commercial disputes and employment issues. As
of the date of this filing, we are not involved in any pending legal proceedings that we believe
would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. However, certain pending disputes involve claims by third parties that our activities
infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights. These claims
generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the
allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or
royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property. For
example, on July&nbsp;23, 2009, TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. filed a complaint against us and certain of
our subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court, District of Arizona seeking declaratory judgment that
four of our patents relating to RF filter technology used in our wireless products are invalid and,
if valid, that TriQuint&#146;s products do not infringe any of those patents. TriQuint subsequently
withdrew those claims with respect to three of those four patents. In addition, TriQuint claims
that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents. TriQuint is seeking damages in
an unspecified amount, treble damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys fees and
injunctive relief. We filed our answer and initial counterclaim on September&nbsp;17, 2009, denying
infringement, asserting the invalidity of TriQuint&#146;s patents and asserting infringement by TriQuint
of ten Avago patents and filed additional counterclaims on March&nbsp;25, 2010 for the misappropriation
of Avago trade secrets. On October&nbsp;16, 2009, TriQuint filed its answer to our initial counterclaim,
denying infringement and filed an antitrust counterclaim and counterclaims for declaratory judgment
of non-infringement and invalidity. While the court dismissed TriQuint&#146;s antitrust counterclaims on
procedural grounds on March&nbsp;16, 2010, TriQuint filed a motion to file an amended pleading for its
anti-trust claims, which was granted on August&nbsp;3, 2010. We intend to defend this lawsuit
vigorously, and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional claims or
counterclaims against TriQuint related to our intellectual property portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on February&nbsp;8, 2010, PixArt Imaging Inc. filed an action against us in the U.S
District Court, Northern District of California seeking a determination of whether PixArt is
licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products pursuant to an
existing cross-license agreement between us and PixArt, which license is limited to optical mouse
and optical mouse trackball products. We did not license to PixArt our patents for optical finger
navigation products. We intend to defend this action vigorously and to seek to have the scope of
the cross-license agreement properly construed by the court as excluding such products. We also
filed a counterclaim against PixArt on March&nbsp;31, 2010, asserting that PixArt has breached the terms
of the cross-license agreement between the parties. We are seeking a determination that PixArt is
not licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products, damages in an
unspecified amount, termination for breach, or rescission, of the license agreement and attorneys
fees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2010 we filed a patent infringement action against ST Microelectronics N.V. in
the Eastern District of Texas for infringement of four of our patents related to optical navigation
devices. We amended the complaint on July&nbsp;6, 2010 adding infringement of a fifth optical navigation
related patent to the action. We are seeking injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount,
treble damages for willful infringement and attorneys fees. In response, ST Microelectronics filed
a patent infringement action against us in the Northern District of Texas alleging that our sales
of certain optical navigation devices infringed two ST Microelectronics&#146; patents. ST
Microelectronics is seeking injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. ST
Microelectronics filed a second suit against us on November&nbsp;5, 2010 in the Northern District of
California alleging certain anticompetitive actions by us in the optical navigation sensor market.
ST Microelectronics is seeking injunctive and compensatory relief under the Sherman Act and the
Clayton Act and attorneys fees. On January&nbsp;4, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss ST
Microelectronics&#146; claims relating to anticompetitive actions by us and on April&nbsp;11, 2011, the court
ordered a stay of this matter pending resolution of the patent litigation in the Eastern district
of Texas; on June&nbsp;17, 2011 ST Microelectronics filed a motion to transfer this matter to the
Eastern District of Texas. We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, and future actions may
include the assertion by us of additional claims or counterclaims against ST Microelectronics
related to our intellectual property portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;21, 2011, we filed a patent infringement action against Cypress Semiconductor
Corporation, or Cypress, for infringement of three of our patents related to optical navigation
devices. We are seeking injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount, treble damages for
willful infringement and expenses and attorneys fees. On May&nbsp;23, 2011, Cypress filed its answer and
counterclaim against us for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the
patents asserted by us. On August&nbsp;22, 2011, Cypress filed an amended answer and counterclaim
alleging infringement by us of five of Cypress&#146;s patents. In its counterclaim Cypress is seeking
injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount, treble damages for willful infringement and
costs and attorneys&#146; fees. We intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously, and future actions may
include the assertion by us of additional claims or counterclaims against Cypress related to our
intellectual property portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third-party intellectual
property rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers)
often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain.
Moreover, from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights.
Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex intellectual property litigation is
generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel.

and, where applicable, update our risk factors each quarter. The description set forth below
supersedes the description of the risk factors previously disclosed in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A of our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May&nbsp;1, 2011. These risk factors, which
could materially affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations, are not the
only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Business</B>
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>Concerns regarding the global economic situation could have a negative effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global economic downturn and financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 led to slower economic
activity, unemployment, concerns about inflation and energy costs, decreased business and consumer
confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and lower
levels of liquidity in many financial markets. The resulting global recession also led to reduced
customer spending in the semiconductor market and in our target markets during 2009, made it
difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business
activities, and caused U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products. It also caused
consumers to reduce spending on many products our customers make, such as personal computers,
mobile phone and flat screen televisions. In recent months, market and business conditions in
general have been affected by investor and customer concerns and about the global economic outlook,
including concerns about the economic recovery in the U.S. A slowdown in the economic
recovery or worsening global economic conditions as a result of these or other factors will likely
cause our customers and consumers to reduce spending and could lead to the insolvency of key
suppliers, resulting in product delays, and in customer insolvencies, all of which could negatively
affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant
downturns.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid
technological change and price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles
(for semiconductors and for the end-user products in which they are used) and wide fluctuations in
product supply and demand. From time to time, these and other factors, together with changes in
general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and
in our business in particular. For example, the global semiconductor market experienced substantial
declines in 2001 and 2009, in each case beyond the declines experienced in the typical cycles
experienced by the semiconductor industry, due in large part to deteriorating global economic
conditions during those periods. Periods of industry downturns have been characterized by
diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment,
underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of
average selling prices, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even
when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. In addition, in any future economic
downturn we may be unable to grow our revenues or reduce our costs quickly enough to maintain our
operating profitability.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in
the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of
factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:

research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs. Any failure to adjust spending
quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such
revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of
our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, an immediate and significant decline in the
trading price of our ordinary shares may occur.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is subject to constant and rapid changes in technology, frequent
new product introductions, short product life cycles, rapid product obsolescence and evolving
technical standards. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our products and
require unbudgeted upgrades that could be expensive and time consuming to implement. Our products
could become obsolete sooner than we expect because of faster than anticipated, or unanticipated,
changes in one or more of the technologies related to our products. Furthermore, we continually
evaluate expenditures for research and development and must choose among alternative technologies
based on our expectations of future market growth and other factors. We may be unable to develop
and introduce new or enhanced products that satisfy customer requirements and achieve market
acceptance in a timely manner or at all, the technologies where we have focused our research and
development expenditures may not become commercially successful, and we may be unable to anticipate
new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully
to new product announcements and introductions by competitors. If we fail to adapt successfully to
technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we may be unable to
retain customers, attract new customers or sell new products to our existing customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes
third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities. As a result, we are highly reliant on
third-party foundry wafer fabrication capacity, including sole sourcing for many components or
products. For certain of our product families, substantially all of our revenue from those products
is derived from semiconductors fabricated by external foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company Ltd. and WIN Semiconductor Corp. We also use third-party contract
manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including Amertron
Incorporated, the Hana Microelectronics Public Company Ltd. group of companies, and SAE Magnetics
(HK)

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Ltd. The ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside
of our control. If one or more of our
contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely
manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our
reputation could suffer. If one of our suppliers, particularly a single-source supplier, ceases to,
or is unable to, manufacture such a component or supply is otherwise constrained, we may be forced
to re-engineer a product or we may fail to meet customer demand. In addition to discontinuing
parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity
constraints or other factors. For example, in the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or
eliminated at one or more facilities, including as a response by contract manufacturers to cycles
in the semiconductor industry or as a result of unanticipated events such as the recent major
earthquakes and tsunami in Japan, manufacturing could be disrupted, we could have difficulties
fulfilling our customer orders, which could result in the payment of significant damages by us to
our customers, and our net revenue could decline. In addition, if these third parties on whom we
are highly reliant fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable
prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could
decline. In such events, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
adversely affected. As a result of the disaster in Japan, we are reviewing our supply chain and
may seek to qualify second sources for some components and products. Qualifying such second
sources may be a lengthy and potentially costly process.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we operate using a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we do rely on
the manufacturing facilities we own, in particular our fabrication facilities in Fort Collins,
Colorado and Singapore. We maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our
innovative materials and processes, to protect our intellectual property and to develop the
technology for manufacturing. A prolonged disruption or material malfunction of, interruption in or
the loss of operations at one or more of our production facilities, especially our Fort Collins and
Singapore facilities, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these
facilities, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development
until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. The lease on our primary
internal fabrication facility in Singapore expires in 2015. If we are unable to renew this lease on
satisfactory terms, we would be required to locate suitable replacement premises, with the goal of
ensuring a smooth transition between facilities on or prior to the expiration of our current lease.
However, the replacement of this, or any other, manufacturing facility could take an extended
amount of time and significant expenditures on our part before manufacturing operations could
restart. While we would seek to minimize any disruption to our operations and supply chain
associated with any such changes in manufacturing facilities, we may experience delays and
significant costs resulting from these steps, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited
to, networks, applications, and outsourced services. We continually enhance and implement new
systems and processes throughout our global operations. For example, we are planning to upgrade our
primary enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system later this calendar year to provide for
greater depth and breadth of functionality. Problems with transitioning to the upgraded system, or
the failure of the upgraded system to operate effectively, could disrupt our operations and
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations by
harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain and production
facilities, fulfill customer orders, and report financial and management information on a timely
and accurate basis. In addition, due to the systemic internal control features within ERP systems,
we may experience difficulties that could affect our internal control over financial reporting,
which could create a significant deficiency or material weakness in our overall internal controls
under Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

accurately estimate our customers&#146; demand could adversely affect our results of operations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek
and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing,
personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements.
The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes
in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer
requirements. Our results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our supply chain
volume to address market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of
the markets in which we operate, or by other unanticipated events such as the major earthquakes and
tsunami that occurred in Japan in March&nbsp;2011. The sale of our products is dependent, to a large
degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for
their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile and is
subject to seasonality related to the holiday selling season, making demand difficult to
anticipate. A number of our suppliers are located in Japan, and we believe that many of our
customers also depend on suppliers of their own located in Japan. While we typically carry some
additional inventory to meet the fluctuating demands of our customers, any delays in product
delivery from Japanese suppliers may have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver our products
to our customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, even if we
do not experience any delays in delivery from our Japanese suppliers, if our customers cannot
timely source other components or materials from their suppliers in Japan, they may scale back
their manufacturing, which would likely cause them to cancel or scale back their orders from us,
and this may, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can challenge our
resources and reduce margins. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient
supplies or components, or secure sufficient contract manufacturing capacity, to meet increasing
product demand, which could harm our reputation, prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities
and reduce revenue growth. In addition, some parts are not readily available from alternate
suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order to secure components for the production of our products, we may continue to enter into
non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors or make advance payments to suppliers, which could
reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. Prior
commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our products has
decreased. Downturns in the semiconductor industry have in the past caused, and may in the future
cause, our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products ordered from us. If demand for
our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be
forced to incur additional charges. Conversely, if OEMs order more of our products in any
particular quarter than are ultimately required to satisfy end customer demand, inventories at
these OEMs may grow in such quarter, which could adversely affect our product revenues in a
subsequent quarter as such OEMs would likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels
realign with end customer demand. In addition, because certain of our sales, research and
development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in
customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require advanced
equipment. We and our suppliers, as well as our competitors, continuously modify these processes in
an effort to improve yields and product performance. Defects or other difficulties in the
manufacturing process can reduce yields and increase costs. Our manufacturing efficiency will be an
important factor in our future financial performance, and we may be unable to maintain or increase
our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. For products that we outsource
manufacturing, our product yields and performance will be subject to the manufacturing efficiencies
of our third-party suppliers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we and our suppliers have experienced difficulty in beginning production at
new facilities, transferring production to other facilities, achieving and maintaining a high level
of process quality and effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes, all of which have
caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. We and our suppliers may
experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery
delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays,
transferring production to other facilities (as we may be required to do with our manufacturing
facility in Singapore, in or prior to 2015), upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing
our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of
operations could be adversely affected by any increase in costs related to increases in production
capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are focused on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as &#147;design wins,&#148; to
develop semiconductors for use in our customers&#146; products. These selection processes are typically

scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After winning a product design, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents,
copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers
and distributors their patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property
rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, we are currently involved
in a dispute with TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., or TriQuint, in which, among other things, TriQuint
is seeking a judgment that one of our patents relating to RF filter technology used in our wireless
products is invalid and, if valid, that TriQuint&#146;s products do not infringe that patent, and is
claiming that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents. See Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate these rights, regardless of
their merit or resolution, are frequently costly and divert the efforts and attention of our
management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our customer agreements and in some cases
our asset sale agreements require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party
intellectual property infringement claims, which have required and may in the future require that
we defend those claims, and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings.
Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future
customers from doing business with us. We do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings
given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global semiconductor market is highly competitive. We compete in different target markets
to various degrees on the basis of, among other things, quality, technical performance, price,
product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering
expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery
timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support. Current and prospective customers
for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. Some of
our competitors are well established, have a more extensive product portfolio, have substantially
greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources
to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. In
addition, many of our competitors have longer independent operating histories, greater presence in
key markets, more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition. We compete with
integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the
internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. Our competitors range from large, international
companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in
narrow markets. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to
increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, companies
not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Because
our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be
integrated into more complex integrated circuits, or ICs, we also face competition from
manufacturers of ICs, as well as customers that develop their own IC products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our
control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our
industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of
semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels.
The actions of our competitors, particularly in the area of pricing, can have a substantial adverse
impact on our revenues, and potentially on revenues in specific industry end markets. In periods
where the semiconductor industry experiences significant declines, manufacturers in financial
difficulties or in bankruptcy may implement pricing structures
designed to ensure short-term market share and near-term

dollars for the foreseeable future, due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan
to develop. We do not know whether we will have sufficient resources to maintain or increase the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently, and from time to time may be, subject to warranty or product liability
claims that have lead, and may in the future lead, to significant expenses as we compensate
affected customers for costs incurred related to product quality issues. Although we maintain
reserves for reasonably estimable liability and product liability insurance, our reserves may be
inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. Conversely, in some cases, amounts we
reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be
reversed. For example, in the second quarter of 2009 we identified a product quality issue with a
particular component that we took steps to correct, including notifying our customers and offering
to replace such components. We are continuing our discussions with affected customers regarding
this issue, and have compensated or otherwise rectified the issue with many of those customers. As
at July&nbsp;31, 2011, we had recorded an aggregate of $13&nbsp;million in charges (including a reversal of
warranty accrual of $4&nbsp;million in the quarter ended May&nbsp;1, 2011) associated with this issue, and
may incur additional charges as we continue to work with our customers to resolve the matter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we maintain product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to significant
deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect
against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. We may
incur costs and expenses in the event of any recall of a customer&#146;s product containing one of our
devices. The process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed
may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs,
contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Our customer contracts typically
contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases liquidated damages provisions
relating to product quality issues. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are
significant, and in some cases are potentially unlimited, and may greatly exceed any revenues we
receive from such products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with
warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially, adversely affect our

unforeseen difficulties during product development. We have in the past experienced, and may in the
future experience, these defects, bugs and delays. If any of our products contain defects or bugs,
or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully design
workarounds. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our
products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers,
attract new customers, and our financial results. In addition, these defects or bugs could
interrupt or delay sales to our customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest
significant capital and other resources. Although our products are tested by our suppliers, our
customers and ourselves, it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs. If any
of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new
product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or
replacement costs. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others.
For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a
customer&#146;s product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that
customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. In addition, these
problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts, and we would

decline in our customers&#146; markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and
make it more difficult to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. For example, if the Asian
market does not continue to grow as anticipated or if the semiconductor market declines, our
results of operations will likely suffer. In such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify
and, if we were unable to respond quickly, could significantly reduce our gross margins. To the
extent we cannot offset recessionary periods or periods of reduced growth that may occur in these
markets through increased market share or otherwise, our net revenue may decline and our business,
financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Pricing pressures and competition are
especially intense in semiconductor-related industries, which could prevent achievement of our
long-term financial goals and could require us to implement additional cost-cutting measures.
Furthermore, industry growth rates may not be as forecasted, which could result in us spending on

sales to Cisco Systems, Inc., when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to Cisco through
contract manufacturers that Cisco utilizes, may have exceeded 10% of our net revenues for the nine
months ended July&nbsp;31, 2011. We believe our top
customers&#146; purchasing power has given them the ability to make greater demands on their suppliers,
including us. We expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affect our gross margins on
certain products. In addition, we expect this will result in our results of operations becoming
increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of, or other adverse
developments related to, one or more of our significant customers. Although we believe that our

indications of their product needs and purchases on an annual basis, they generally purchase our
products on a weekly or daily basis and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can be
terminated at any time. The loss of any
of our major customers, or any substantial reduction in sales to any of these customers, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We either obtain the products we need for our business from third-party contract manufacturers
or we obtain the materials we need for our products from suppliers, some of which are our single
source suppliers for these materials. We purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor
materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers. For fiscal year 2010,
we purchased 54% of the materials for our manufacturing processes from eight suppliers. For the
first nine months of fiscal year 2011, we purchased 56% of the materials for our manufacturing
processes from seven suppliers. Substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis,
and we have not generally entered into long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers or
suppliers. In the event that these purchase orders or relationships with suppliers are terminated,
we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices, the quality of the
material deteriorates, we fail to satisfy our customers&#146; requirements or we are not able to pass on
higher materials or energy costs to our customers, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing processes rely on many materials, including silicon and GaAs wafers, copper
lead frames, precious metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. From
time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity
price increases, capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that our current
supplies of materials are adequate, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use third-party contractor manufacturers for most of our manufacturing activities,
primarily for wafer fabrication and module assembly and test services. Our agreements with these
manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs, commit to purchase services
consistent with these forecasts and may require other commitments in the early stages of the
relationship. Our operations could be adversely affected in the event that these contractual
relationships were disrupted or terminated, the cost of such services increased significantly, the
quality of the services provided deteriorated, our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect or
capacity is consumed by our competitors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on third-party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services,
including, among other things, certain services related to accounting, billing, human resources,
information technology, or IT, network development and network monitoring. We depend on these
vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business
requirements. The ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable, high
quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control.
While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us,
our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do
not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would
be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor&#146;s failure to
perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon
expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to
replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including
service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another
vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.

capacity utilization.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, with proprietary products and products
sold into our industrial and automotive target market typically providing higher gross margin than
other products. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products could adversely affect
our future gross margin percentages. In addition, OEMs are becoming increasingly price conscious
when they design semiconductors from third party suppliers into their products. This sensitivity
can lead to intense price competition by competing suppliers, which may require us to decrease our
prices in order to win a design with an OEM customer, which can adversely affect our gross margin.
Our margin may also be affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, either directly in the price
of the raw materials we buy, or as a result of prices increases passed on to us by our suppliers.
Many commodities prices, including those of gold and fuel, have risen significantly in recent
months. We do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices and continued increases in commodities
prices may adversely affect our gross margin.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to
high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. Although we outsource a significant portion of
our manufacturing activities, we do retain some semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are
unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with
these facilities will
not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins. In the
past, we have experienced periods where our gross margins declined due to, among other things,
reduced factory utilization resulting from reduced customer demand, reduced selling prices and a
change in product mix towards lower margin devices. Increased competition and the existence of
product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand and other factors may
lead to further price erosion, lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our factories, facilities and distribution system, and those of our contract manufacturers,
are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, or other natural or man-made
disasters. The majority of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in
the Pacific Rim region, a region with above average seismic and severe weather activity. In
addition, our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations, primarily
Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Fort Collins, Colorado and San Jose, California, with the expertise of
the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas. Any
catastrophic natural disaster in those regions or catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of
our facilities in those regions would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments
and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility, and in some
instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product
area or target market. In addition, any catastrophic loss at our Fort Collins, Colorado, San Jose,

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax
holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For
example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an
agency of the Government of Singapore, which provide that certain classes of income we earn in
Singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each such tax
incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended,
modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other
incentives. In order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet certain operating
conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a treasury
function, a corporate headquarters function, specified intellectual property activities and
specified manufacturing activities in Singapore. Some of these operating conditions are subject to
phase-in periods through 2015. The Singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at
various dates generally between 2014 and 2025. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax
rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17% commencing from the 2010&nbsp;year of
assessment. For the fiscal years ended November&nbsp;1, 2009 and October&nbsp;31, 2010, the effect of all
these tax incentives, in the aggregate, was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from
what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately $17&nbsp;million and $63&nbsp;million,
respectively. The tax incentives that we have negotiated in other jurisdictions are also subject to
our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot or elect not to comply
with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related
tax benefits and could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with
respect to that incentive and, depending on the incentive at issue, could likely be required to
modify our operational structure and tax strategy. Any such modified structure or strategy may not
be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits
provided under the present tax concession arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing
authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives
are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial
consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our
cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our
operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an
arm&#146;s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm&#146;s length standard among taxing
authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by
tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense. We
are subject to, and are under, audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess
additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final
determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions
and accruals. The ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses
that offer complementary products, services and technologies, augment our market coverage, or
enhance our technological capabilities. We may also enter into strategic
alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to identify suitable acquisition, investment, alliance, or joint venture opportunities or that we
will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions
acceptable to us, or that such transactions or relationships will be successful.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties.
For example, the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in
disruption to other parts of our business. In addition, the integration may require that we incur
significant restructuring charges. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage
the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of these integrations may be further
complicated by such factors as the size of the business or entity acquired, geographic distances,
lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business,
delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses,
diversion of management&#146;s attention from daily operations of the business, potential loss of key
employees and customers of the acquired business, the potential for deficiencies in internal
controls at the acquired or combined business, performance problems with the acquired business&#146;
technology, difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior
experience, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, insufficient revenues
to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition, and our potential inability to
achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition. Even when an
acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that
product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre-acquisition due diligence
will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities, acquire goodwill and non-amortizable
intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges,
incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, increase our expenses and working
capital requirements, and subject us to litigation, which would reduce our return on invested
capital. In addition, if the businesses or products lines that we acquire have a different pricing
or cost structure than we do, such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce
our overall margin. Failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to
improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business,
operating results and margins.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which, in the case of
debt financing, would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings, and in the
case of equity financing, would be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any downgrades in our
credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by
resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be
able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent
as in the past, or at all. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated
levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like
the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S.

regulations, our business could be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and
adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to

required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from
distributing our products commercially until the products or component substances are brought into
compliance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to a variety of international and U.S. laws and other legal requirements
relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to, hazardous materials. Any failure
by us to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation
or suspension of production or subject us to future liabilities in excess of our reserves. In
addition, compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could restrict our ability
to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, incur other
significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes. In the event of the discovery of new
contamination, additional requirements with respect to existing contamination, or the
imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take
remedial or other measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we
adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the
restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified
electronics products sold in the European Union as of July&nbsp;1, 2006 under the Restriction of
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Other countries, such as the
United States, China and Japan, have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to the EU
legislation. Other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize
components that are more environmentally compatible. Such reengineering and component substitution
may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, we
may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government
agencies and private parties. We may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future
alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. A significant judgment against
us could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing
on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and
certain illnesses, primarily different types of cancers. Regulatory agencies and industry
associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists. Because we
utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims. In addition, these reports may also
affect our ability to recruit and retain employees.

restructuring charges in the future.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2009, we pursued a number of restructuring initiatives designed to reduce
costs and increase revenue across our operations, in large part due to the global economic downturn
and related decline in demand for our customers&#146; products. These initiatives included significant
workforce reductions in certain areas as we realigned our business, establishing certain operations
closer in location to our global customers, evaluating functions more efficiently performed through
partnerships or other outside relationships and steps to attempt to further reduce our overhead
costs. As a result of these initiatives, we incurred restructuring charges of $34&nbsp;million in fiscal
year 2009, $4&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2010 and $3&nbsp;million in the first nine months of fiscal year
2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be required to take additional charges in the future as we continue to evaluate our
operations and cost structures relative to general economic conditions, market demands, our cost
competitiveness, our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers&#146; production requirements
and our research and development focus. We cannot assure you as to the timing or amount of any such
additional future restructuring charges. If we are required to take additional restructuring
charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows may be adversely
impacted. Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that
could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of
the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sell many of our products to customers through distributors who maintain their own
inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users. We recognize revenues for sales to
distributors upon delivery to the distributor. We limit distributor return rights and we allow
limited price adjustments on sales to distributors. We provide reserves for distributor rights
related to these limited stock returns and price adjustments. Sales to distributors accounted for
41% and 37% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2010 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2011,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products
in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any
reason, such as due to the recent global recession or due to any downturn in technology spending,
our sales to these distributors and our revenues may decline. In addition, if distributors decide
to purchase more inventory in any particular quarter, due to product availability or other reasons,
than is required to satisfy end customer demand, inventory at our distributors may grow in such
quarter, which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such
distributors will likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end
customer demand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also face the risk that our distributors may for other reasons have inventory levels of our
products in excess of future anticipated sales. If such sales do not occur in the time frame
anticipated by these distributors for any reason, these distributors may substantially decrease the
amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods, which would harm our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our reserve estimates associated with products stocked by our distributors are based largely
on reports that our distributors provide to us on a monthly basis. To date, we believe this data
has been generally accurate. To the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is
inaccurate or not received in a timely manner, we may not be able to make reserve estimates for
future periods accurately or at all.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We sell many of our products to customers through distributors and manufacturers&#146; representatives,
as well as through our employee sales representatives. We are unable to predict the extent to which
our distributors and manufacturers&#146; representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our
products. Moreover, many of our distributors and manufacturers&#146; representatives and distributors
also market and sell competing products. Our relationships with our representatives and
distributors may be terminated by either party at any time. As part of a change in strategy, in
order to more effectively manage sales representatives&#146; performance, in 2010 we terminated our
relationships with a substantial number of our manufacturing representatives in the United States
and have replaced them with additional employee representatives. In addition, in June&nbsp;2011, we
reduced the number of our global, full-line distributors, by changing one of them to a regional,
full-line distributor. We continue to evaluate our sales and distribution strategies and may make
further changes in the future. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to
attract additional distributors or manufacturers&#146; representatives that will be able to market and
support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed
our products, and on our ability to effectively manage distribution efforts by our remaining
global, full-line distributors. If we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers&#146;
representatives, recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers&#146; representatives,
or effectively manage changes to our sales and distributions strategies our sales and operating
results will be harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications. As a result, the
prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly. Gross profits on our products may be
negatively affected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers, and the
proportion of sales of our wireless and other products into consumer application markets, which are
highly competitive and cost sensitive. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of
our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by
us or our competitors and other factors. Our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we
are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes,
reducing manufacturing costs, or developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis.

annually, as required by Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Even though, as at October&nbsp;31,
2010, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, we need to
maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes. This
continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with Section&nbsp;404
is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain
that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial
processes and reporting and ensure compliance with Section&nbsp;404. Furthermore, as we grow our
business or acquire other businesses, our internal controls may become more complex and we may
require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to implement required
new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, either in our
existing business or in businesses that we may acquire, could harm our operating results or cause
us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting
firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if
quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the
trading price of our ordinary shares may decline.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore, and certain of our officers
and directors are resident outside the United States. Moreover, a majority of our consolidated
assets are located outside the United States. Although we are incorporated outside the United
States, we have agreed to accept service of process in the United States through our agent
designated for that purpose. Nevertheless, since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us

not be collectible within the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no treaty between the United States and Singapore providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for
the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws, would, therefore, not
be automatically enforceable in Singapore. There is doubt whether a Singapore court may impose
civil liability on us or our directors and officers who reside in Singapore in a suit brought in
the Singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal
securities laws of the United States, unless the facts surrounding such a violation would
constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Singapore law. Consequently, it may be difficult
for investors to enforce against us, our directors or our officers in Singapore judgments obtained
in the United States, which are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies,
including ours. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general
economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or
international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares.
You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your
investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their
stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of
litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and
divert our management&#146;s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our
business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the public market, including by
members of our management, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market
price of our ordinary shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of
additional equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;1, 2011, approximately 41.3&nbsp;million outstanding ordinary shares are subject to
the contractual transfer restrictions in our Shareholder Agreement, which is described under
&#147;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions &#151; Second Amended
and Restated Shareholder Agreement &#151; Transfer Restrictions&#148; in the definitive proxy statement
for our 2011 annual general meeting of shareholders. The Company and the Sponsors may decide to
waive the restrictions in the Shareholder Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;1, 2011, holders of approximately 41.3&nbsp;million ordinary shares are entitled to
rights with respect to registration of such shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, pursuant to a
registration rights agreement with us. These holders have exercised their registration rights
several times since our since our initial public offering, or IPO, in August&nbsp;2009 and if such
holders, by exercising their registration rights or otherwise, continue to sell a large number of
shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares. If we register the
sale of additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders
in such registration pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise
capital may be impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, shares issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans, including such shares
issued to members of our management, may be freely sold in the public market upon vesting and
issuance, subject to the restrictions provided under the terms of the plan and option agreement
under which they were issued, applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase shares.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the Company will pay
quarterly dividends on our ordinary shares and has also approved a program to repurchase up to 15
million of the company&#146;s ordinary shares, not to exceed $500&nbsp;million in the aggregate. However, the
declaration and payment of any future dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors
and our dividend policy could change at any time. Similarly, our share repurchase program may be
suspended or terminated at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends
or repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. Furthermore, any dividend,
if declared, may be an interim dividend, under Singapore law, which is wholly provisional and may
be revoked by our Board of Directors at any time prior to the payment thereof. The payment of cash
dividends is restricted by applicable law and our corporate structure. Pursuant to Singapore law
and our articles of association, no dividends may be paid except out of our profits. Also, because
we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares and to
repurchase our shares may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds
through dividends from subsidiaries, including restrictions under the terms of our credit
agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future dividends and share repurchases, their timing and amount, as well as the relative
allocation of cash between dividends and share repurchases, may be affected by, among other
factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including
acquisitions; earnings levels; contractual restrictions; cash position and overall financial
condition; and changes to our business model. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of
shares we are able to repurchase under our share repurchase program may further be affected by a
number of other factors, including the share price and blackout periods in which we are restricted
from repurchasing shares. A reduction in, or elimination of, our dividend payments and/or share
repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management&#146;s attention
and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, listing requirements of The
Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with
these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, places significant
demands on our systems, resources and management. As a result, management&#146;s attention may be
diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. We may also need to hire more employees in the
future, which will increase our costs and expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and
public disclosure, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
are creating uncertainty for public companies, further increasing legal and financial compliance
costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are
subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a
result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance
matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this
investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of
management&#146;s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our
efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by
regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may
initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a public company makes it expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to
obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain
qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on committees of our board of
directors, and qualified executive officers.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers contains provisions that may delay, deter or
prevent a future takeover or change in control of our company for so long as we remain a public
company with more than 50 shareholders and net tangible assets of S$5&nbsp;million or more. Any person
acquiring an interest, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not, either on
their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person, in 30% or more of our voting
shares, or, if such person holds, either on their own or together with parties acting in concert
with such person, between 30% and 50% (both inclusive) of our voting shares, and such person (or
parties acting in concert with such person) acquires additional voting shares representing more
than 1% of our voting shares in any six-month period, must, except with the consent of the
Securities Industry Council in Singapore, extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining
voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers.
While the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers seeks to ensure equality of treatment among
shareholders, its provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an
actual or threatened change of control of our company. These legal requirements may impede or delay
a takeover of our company by a third-party, which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary
shares.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our
management&#146;s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which consists of forward- looking
statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and
the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a
view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other
independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such
person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with
numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific
assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally
state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis
as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall
outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a
basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not
accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the
assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from
actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is
realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations
may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial
data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing,
investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the
events or circumstances set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could result in the actual
operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and
material.

prior to taking on additional work outside Avago and to prohibit employees from acting as &#147;industry
experts&#148; or &#147;industry consultants&#148;, either paid or unpaid, in which capacity they provide to third
parties non-public and/or confidential information about the Company&#146;s business or the business of
its customers or suppliers; and (ii)&nbsp;the Confidentiality section was amended to prohibit persons
covered by the Code of Conduct from using non-public, confidential or proprietary information about
the Company or other companies obtained in the course of their employment with, or service to, the
Company for personal gain, such as disclosing information to third parties in exchange for
consulting fees or other financial incentives. The amendments took effect upon adoption by the
Board.
