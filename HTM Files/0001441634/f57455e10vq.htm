</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avago Technologies Limited, or the Company, we, our, or Avago, was organized under the laws of
the Republic of Singapore in August&nbsp;2005. We are the successor to the Semiconductor Products Group,
or SPG, of Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent. On December&nbsp;1, 2005, we acquired substantially
all of the assets of SPG from Agilent for $2.7&nbsp;billion, or the SPG Acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a designer, developer and global supplier of analog semiconductor devices with a focus
on III-V based products. We offer products in four primary target markets: wireless communications,
wired infrastructure, industrial and automotive electronics, and consumer and computing
peripherals. Applications for our products in these target markets include cellular phones,
consumer appliances, data networking and telecommunications equipment, enterprise storage and
servers, factory automation, displays, optical mice and printers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Basis of Presentation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fiscal Periods. </I>We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest
to October&nbsp;31. Our first quarter of fiscal year 2011 ended on January&nbsp;30, 2011, the second
quarter will end on May&nbsp;1, 2011, the third quarter will end on July&nbsp;31, 2011 and the fourth quarter
will end on October&nbsp;30, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Information. </I>The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Avago and all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interim information presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements has
been prepared by management and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments of a normal
recurring nature that are necessary for the fair statement of the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods shown, and is in accordance with GAAP. These unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended October&nbsp;31, 2010, or fiscal year
2010, included in Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
the SEC, on December&nbsp;15, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating results for the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending October&nbsp;30, 2011, or fiscal year 2011, or for
any other future period. The balance sheet data as of October&nbsp;31, 2010 presented is derived from
the audited financial statements as of that date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Use of estimates. </I>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could affect the results of
operations reported in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Concentrations of credit risk and significant customers. </I>Our cash, cash
equivalents and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash
and cash equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high
credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in
the U.S. and internationally. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally
diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion
across many different industries and geographies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers&#146; financial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank
guarantees, in certain circumstances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sell our products through our direct sales force and distributors. No customer accounted
for 10% or more of our net accounts receivable balance at October&nbsp;31, 2010. One customer accounted
for 10% of our net accounts receivable balance at January&nbsp;30, 2011. For the quarter ended January
30, 2011, no single customer represented 10% or more of net revenue. One customer represented 10%
of net revenue for the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Concentration of other risks</I>. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns. Our financial
results are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general economic conditions worldwide,
economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly
evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricators and
independent distributors. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and
subject to significant economic downturns at various times. We are exposed to the risk of
obsolescence of our inventory depending on the mix of future business.

<!-- Keep Ignore Comment, per XBRLMARK -->
<!-- /xbrl,ig -->


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the guidance issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board or FASB on the milestone method of revenue recognition became effective. The new
guidance recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition method for
substantive milestones in research or development transactions. A milestone is substantive when the
consideration earned from achievement of the milestone is commensurate with either (a)&nbsp;the vendor&#146;s
performance to achieve the milestone or (b)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s)
as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone
and the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone relates solely to past performance
and is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential
milestone considerations) within the arrangement. The guidance may be applied retrospectively to
all arrangements or prospectively to milestones achieved after the effective date. The adoption of
this guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial
position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we adopted the FASB&#146;s updated guidance that amends
the requirements for evaluating whether a decision maker or service provider has a variable
interest to clarify that a quantitative approach should not be the sole consideration in assessing
the criteria. It also clarifies that related parties should be considered in applying all of the
decision maker and service provider criteria. This is in addition to the authoritative guidance the
FASB issued in June&nbsp;2009 that applies to determining whether an entity is a variable interest
entity and requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s
variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
entity. This new guidance eliminates the exceptions to consolidating qualifying special-purpose
entities, contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, and increases the
frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity. The guidance also contains a new requirement that any term, transaction,
or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity&#146;s status as a variable interest
entity, a company&#146;s power over a variable interest entity, or a company&#146;s obligation to absorb
losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying the existing
provisions. The elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept and its consolidation
exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and
financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we adopted the guidance the FASB issued on revenue
recognition that addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables
contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated
among the separate units of accounting. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or
prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. The adoption of this guidance did not
have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we adopted the FASB guidance that modifies the scope
of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a)&nbsp;non-software components of tangible
products and (b)&nbsp;software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed or leased with
tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product
function together to deliver the tangible product&#146;s essential functionality. The guidance may be
applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. The adoption
of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial
position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and
disclosures, which requires separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements
relating to Level 3 fair value measurements (see Note 6. &#147;Fair Value&#148; for further discussion of
fair value measurements). This guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending October&nbsp;28,
2012, and its interim periods. Other than requiring additional disclosures in our financial
statements, we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our
results of operations and financial position.

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we acquired a U.S. - based company engaged in
the manufacturing of integrated circuits for approximately $8&nbsp;million in cash. The purchase price
was allocated to the acquired net assets based on preliminary estimates of fair values as follows:
total assets of $8&nbsp;million, including intangible assets of $4&nbsp;million and goodwill of $3&nbsp;million.
The intangibles are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from 5 to 15&nbsp;years. The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the
acquired business commencing as of the acquisition date. Pro forma results of operations for the
acquisition have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition were not material to our
prior financial statements.

</DIV>


<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
A three level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3 measurements).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements
are described below:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1&#151;Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our
Level 1 assets include money market funds, time deposits and investment funds&#151;deferred
compensation plan assets. We measure money market funds and investment funds at quoted market price
as they are traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions. Time
deposits are highly liquid with maturities of ninety days or less. Due to their short-term
maturities, we have determined that the fair value of time deposits should be at face value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2&#151;Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has
a specified (contractual)&nbsp;term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability. We did not have any Level 2 asset or liability activities during the
quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3&#151;Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is
little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets
and liabilities include cost method investments, goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and
property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow
approach when they are impaired. We did not have any Level 3 asset or liability activities during
the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividend yield of zero, for the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010 is based on the fact that
we had no intention to pay cash dividends as of the respective option grant dates. The dividend
yield for the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011 is based on the yield as of the respective option
grant dates. Expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of guideline
publicly traded companies over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and
the implied volatility of guideline publicly traded
companies from traded options with a term of 180&nbsp;days or greater measured over the last three
months. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the average U.S. Treasury Strips rate during
the period, which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant. Our computation of expected
term was based on data, such as the data of peer companies and company-specific attributes that we
believe could affect employees&#146; exercise behavior.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above assumptions, the weighted-average fair values of the options granted under
the share option plans for the quarters ended January&nbsp;31, 2010 and January&nbsp;30, 2011 were $7.00 and
$10.10, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our historical experience of pre-vesting option cancellations, for the quarters ended
January&nbsp;31, 2010 and January&nbsp;30, 2011 we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 11% and 8%,
respectively, for measuring compensation expense associated with unvested options outstanding
during those quarters. A forfeiture rate was not applied to our expense related to our ESPP due to
the immateriality of expense. We will record additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower
than we estimated, and will record a recovery of prior expense if actual forfeitures are higher
than we estimated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total compensation cost related to unvested options as of January&nbsp;30, 2011 was $79&nbsp;million,
which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 3&nbsp;years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">proceedings that we believe
would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. However, certain pending disputes involve claims by third parties that our activities
infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights. These claims
generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the
allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or
royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property. For
example, on July&nbsp;23, 2009, TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. filed a complaint against us and certain of
our subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court, District of Arizona seeking declaratory judgment that
four of our patents relating to RF filter technology used in our wireless products are invalid and,
if valid, that TriQuint&#146;s products do not infringe any of those patents. TriQuint  subsequently
withdrew those claims with respect to three of those four patents. In addition, TriQuint claims
that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents. TriQuint is seeking damages in
an unspecified amount, treble damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys fees and
injunctive relief. We filed our answer and initial counterclaim on September&nbsp;17, 2009, denying
infringement, asserting the invalidity of TriQuint&#146;s patents and asserting infringement by TriQuint
of ten Avago patents and filed additional counterclaims on March&nbsp;25, 2010 for the misappropriation
of Avago trade secrets. On October&nbsp;16, 2009, TriQuint filed its answer to our initial counterclaim,
denying infringement and filed an antitrust counterclaim and counterclaims for declaratory judgment
of non infringement and invalidity. While the court dismissed TriQuint&#146;s antitrust counterclaims on
procedural grounds on March&nbsp;16, 2010, TriQuint has since filed a motion to file an amended pleading
for its anti-trust claims, which was granted on August&nbsp;3, 2010. We intend to defend this lawsuit
vigorously, and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional claims or
counterclaims against TriQuint related to our intellectual property portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on February&nbsp;8, 2010, PixArt Imaging Inc. filed an action against us in the U.S
District Court, Northern District of California seeking a determination of whether PixArt is
licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products pursuant to an
existing cross-license agreement between us and PixArt, which license is limited to optical mouse
and optical mouse trackball products. We did not license to PixArt our patents for optical finger
navigation products. We intend to defend this action vigorously and to seek to have the scope of
the cross-license agreement properly construed by the court as excluding such products. We also
filed a counterclaim against PixArt on March&nbsp;31, 2010, asserting that PixArt has breached the terms
of the cross-license agreement between the parties. We are seeking a determination that PixArt is
not licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products, damages in an
unspecified amount, termination for breach, or rescission, of the license agreement and attorneys
fees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2010 we filed a patent infringement action against ST Microelectronics NV in the
Eastern District of Texas for infringement of four of our patents related to optical navigation
devices. We amended the complaint on July&nbsp;6, 2010 adding infringement of a fifth optical navigation
related patent to the action. We are seeking injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount,
treble damages for willful infringement and attorneys fees. In response, ST Microelectronics filed
a patent infringement action against us in the Northern District of Texas alleging that our sales
of certain optical navigation devices infringed two ST
Microelectronics&#146; patents. ST Microelectronics is seeking injunctive relief and damages in an
unspecified amount. ST Microelectronics filed a second suit against us on November&nbsp;5, 2010 in the
Northern District of California alleging certain anticompetitive actions by us in the optical
navigation sensor market. ST Microelectronics is seeking injunctive and compensatory relief under
the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and Attorneys fees. On
January&nbsp;4, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss ST
Microelectronics&#146; claims relating to anticompetitive actions by
us.  We intend to
defend these lawsuits vigorously, and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional
claims or counterclaims against ST Microelectronics related to our intellectual property portfolio.

property rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers)
often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain.
Moreover, from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights.
Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex intellectual property
litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and
technical personnel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we notified certain customers of a
product quality issue and began taking additional steps to correct the quality issue and work with
affected customers to determine potential costs covered by our warranty obligations. We maintain
insurance coverage for product liability and have been working with our insurance carriers to
determine the extent of covered losses in this situation. Based on settlements with customers to
date, the status of discussions with other affected customers and discussions with our insurance
carriers, we recorded a charge of $2&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 to cover
costs relating to this quality issue in excess of expected insurance coverage. We continue to have
discussions with affected customers and presently believe that amounts we have recorded in our
financial statements along with expected insurance coverage proceeds will be adequate to resolve
these claims, although this assessment is subject to change based on the ultimate resolution of
this matter with customers and the insurance carriers. In addition, if the timing of settlement of
claims with customers and the timing of determination of insurance recoveries do not occur in the
same reporting periods, there could be material increases in charges to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2009 we identified another product quality issue with a particular
component, took steps to correct the quality issue and notified our customers. Though the expected
failure rate of the product was not 100%, based on our quality tests, we have offered to replace
all such components used or still held by our customers. We recorded charges of $6&nbsp;million during
fiscal year 2009 related to this product quality issue, based on the progress of discussions with
our customers and our evaluation of the best estimate of our exposure related to this matter, which
covered costs to scrap inventory of such components held by us and costs associated with providing
replacement parts to customers. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded additional charges of $11
million to cover customer claims for reimbursements of costs incurred by such customers related to
this product quality issue and also during fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement agreements
with certain customers on this product quality issue. The final settlement amounts approximate the
estimated accrued warranty obligations for those customers. In addition, we made $2&nbsp;million of cash
settlement payments in connection with these agreements during fiscal year 2010, resulting in a $2
million decrease in the warranty accrual for this product quality issue during the same period.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached final settlement agreements with certain
customers and made $1&nbsp;million of cash settlement payments in connection with these agreements,
resulting in a $1&nbsp;million decrease in the warranty accrual for this product quality issue during
the same period. We presently believe that amounts we have recorded in our financial statements
will be adequate to resolve any warranty obligations related to this issue, although this
assessment is subject to change based on the ultimate resolution of this matter with remaining
customers. We continue to have discussions with affected customers on the matter and although we
have made our best estimate of the expected warranty obligation based on available information, we
could record further charges in future periods based on the ultimate resolution of this matter with
such customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agilent Technologies, Inc. has given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard Company in
connection with its activities prior to its spin-off from Hewlett-Packard Company in June&nbsp;1999 for
the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. As the successor to the
Semiconductor Products Group, or SPG, business of Agilent, we have acquired responsibility for
indemnifications related to assigned intellectual property agreements. Additionally, when we
completed the acquisition of SPG from Agilent in December&nbsp;2005, we provided indemnities to Agilent
with regard to Agilent&#146;s conduct of the SPG business prior to the SPG acquisition. In our opinion,
the fair value of these indemnifications is not material.

other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others
with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for
intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify
customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our
businesses or assets and others with whom we enter
into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various
triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products, the use of their goods and
services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and
businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified
maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against
claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental
obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated
estimated fair value of the liability is not material.

All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking, including,
but not limited to, any projections of financial information; any statements about historical
results that may suggest trends for our business; any statements of the plans, strategies, and
objectives of management for future operations; any statements of expectation or belief regarding

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog
semiconductor devices with a focus on III-V based products. III-V semiconductor materials have
higher electrical conductivity and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio
frequency, or RF, and optoelectronic applications than silicon. We differentiate ourselves through
our high performance design and integration capabilities. We serve four primary target markets:
wireless communications, wired infrastructure, industrial and automotive electronics, and consumer
and computing peripherals. Applications for our products in these target markets include cellular
phones, consumer appliances, data networking and telecommunications equipment, enterprise storage
and servers, factory automation, displays, optical mice and printers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on
current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not
readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and
adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical
financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by
management. Those policies include revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible
assets and goodwill, inventory valuation and warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes and
share-based compensation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the quarter
ended January&nbsp;30, 2011 compared to those previously disclosed in &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and

$456&nbsp;million for the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, an increase of $94&nbsp;million or 21%. Net revenue
increased primarily due to strength in the industrial and automotive electronics and wireless
communications target markets in the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011. The increase in net revenue
was also due to significantly improved general economic conditions in the quarter ended January&nbsp;30,
2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010, as well as gains in market share in our three
largest target markets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our three largest target markets, by revenue, are wireless communications, industrial and
automotive electronics and wired infrastructure, with computer and consumer computing peripherals
typically representing a much smaller percentage of our overall net revenues. The percentage of
total net revenues generated by sales into each of our target market varies from quarter to
quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality.
The first fiscal quarter is typically our lowest revenue and cash generating quarter due, in part,
to holiday shut downs at many OEM customers and distributors, and we saw a return to this typical
seasonality during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. In addition, towards the end of calendar
2010 we believe that production at many semiconductor companies had grown faster than end market
demand, resulting in increased inventory levels at some OEMs and distributors. We believe some
customers may have made inventory adjustments during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 as a
result of this.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenue by target market data is derived from our understanding of our end customers&#146;

quarter of the fiscal year 2011 compared with the corresponding prior year period due to continued
strength in mobile handset sales. The growth of key platforms in next-generation smart phones at
leading OEM customers, which incorporate many of our proprietary products such as 3G front-end

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenue from industrial and automotive electronics products, in absolute dollars,
increased substantially in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 compared with the corresponding
prior year period. The increase was in large part due to the effects of a recovery in market
conditions. The growth in this target market was broad based, with particular strength in sales of
optocouplers, industrial fiber optic transceivers and motion encoders. We benefited from increased
spending on and new uses for our devices in applications such as inverters, servo machine tools,
factory automation and infrastructure applications including renewable energy, smart power grid
installations and transportation, as well as gains in market share for a number of these products.

quarter of fiscal year 2011 compared with the corresponding prior year period, as spending on
enterprise networking data centers and core routing improved. We also introduced a number of
parallel fiber optic transceivers and designed new ASICs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011,
compared with the corresponding prior year period, which contributed to the increase in revenue.

optical disc drives in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 as customers worked through excessive
inventory levels.

percentage of net revenue, gross margin increased to 49% for the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011
from 43% for the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010. The increase in gross margin percentage was
attributable to continuing improvements in product mix. During the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011,
compared to the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, a higher proportion of our net revenues were from
products sold into the industrial and automotive electronics target

2010. The decrease in total restructuring charges for the quarter ended January&nbsp;30, 2011 compared
to the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010 was due to our remaining restructuring activities in fiscal
year 2010 in response to the then macroeconomic business conditions.

January&nbsp;30, 2011 and compared to $4&nbsp;million for the quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2010. The decrease is
primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit as a result of U.S. legislation enacted in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2011 retroactively reinstating the research and development tax credit
to 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are affected by seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries. We typically
experience sequentially lower revenues in the first fiscal half of the year. Our revenue in the
second half of the fiscal year is typically higher than our revenue in the first half of the fiscal
year due to seasonality in two of our target markets, consumer and computing peripherals and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary sources of liquidity as at January&nbsp;30, 2011, consisted of: (1)&nbsp;approximately $363
million in cash and cash equivalents, (2)&nbsp;cash we expect to generate from operations and (3)&nbsp;our
$350&nbsp;million revolving credit facility, which is committed until December&nbsp;1, 2011, of which $339
million is available to be drawn (after taking into account $11&nbsp;million of letters of credit
outstanding under the facility). We are actively negotiating a new credit agreement, with a view to
replacing our existing revolving credit facility prior to its expiration in December&nbsp;2011. However,
we may be unable to negotiate a replacement revolving credit facility on acceptable terms or at
all.

In addition, on March 9, 2011, our board of directors of declared an interim cash dividend of $0.08 per ordinary share, payable on March
30, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m.), Eastern Time, on March 18, 2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i)&nbsp;working capital
requirements and (ii)&nbsp;capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time. We may seek to obtain debt or equity
financing in the future. However, we cannot assure that such additional financing will be available
on terms acceptable to us or at all.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur under our current revolving credit
facility or any new revolving credit facility will depend on our ability to generate cash in the
future. We may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity
requirements, other than from available borrowings, if any, under our revolving credit facility. As
a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities, including
acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures or to fund our operations. If we do not have
sufficient cash for these purposes, our financial condition and our business could suffer.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, we paid $258&nbsp;million for the redemption of our remaining $230&nbsp;million senior
subordinated notes at a redemption price of 105.938% of their principal amount, and accrued and
unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, in December
2010, we paid our first interim cash dividend of $0.07 per share, or approximately $17&nbsp;million in
total.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 will be higher than for
fiscal year 2010 due to spending on mask sets for new ASIC designs and capacity expansion in both
our Fort Collins, Colorado and Singapore internal fabrication facilities. We believe that our cash
and cash equivalents on hand, and cash flows from operations, combined with availability under our
revolving credit facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations,
projected working capital requirements and capital spending for at least the next 12&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

compensation and benefits accruals and accrued interest. Accounts payable decreased to $156&nbsp;million
from $198&nbsp;million at the end of fiscal year 2010 mainly due to timing of disbursements. Employee
compensation and benefits decreased to $51&nbsp;million from $82&nbsp;million at fiscal year 2010 mainly due

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <I>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. </I>Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January&nbsp;30, 2011. We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act filings is properly and timely recorded, processed, summarized and
reported. These disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO
concluded that, as of January&nbsp;30, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
the reasonable assurance level.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives, and our management is required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1. Legal Proceedings</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to
companies engaged in our line of business, including commercial disputes and employment issues. As
of the date of this filing, we are not involved in any pending legal proceedings that we believe
would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. However, certain pending disputes involve claims by third parties that our activities
infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights. These claims
generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the
allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or
royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property. For
example, on July&nbsp;23, 2009, TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. filed a complaint against us and certain of
our subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court, District of Arizona seeking declaratory judgment that
four of our patents relating to RF filter technology used in our wireless products are invalid and,
if valid, that TriQuint&#146;s products do not infringe any of those patents. TriQuint  subsequently
withdrew those claims with respect to three of those four patents. In addition, TriQuint claims
that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents. TriQuint is seeking damages in
an unspecified amount, treble damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys fees and
injunctive relief. We filed our answer and initial counterclaim on September&nbsp;17, 2009, denying
infringement, asserting the invalidity of TriQuint&#146;s patents and asserting infringement by TriQuint
of ten Avago patents and filed additional counterclaims on March&nbsp;25, 2010 for the misappropriation
of Avago trade secrets. On October&nbsp;16, 2009, TriQuint filed its answer to our initial counterclaim,
denying infringement and filed an antitrust counterclaim and counterclaims for declaratory judgment
of non infringement and invalidity. While the court dismissed TriQuint&#146;s antitrust counterclaims on
procedural grounds on March&nbsp;16, 2010, TriQuint has since filed a motion to file an amended pleading
for its anti-trust claims, which was granted on August&nbsp;3, 2010. We intend to defend this lawsuit
vigorously, and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional claims or
counterclaims against TriQuint related to our intellectual property portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on February&nbsp;8, 2010, PixArt Imaging Inc. filed an action against us in the U.S
District Court, Northern District of California seeking a determination of whether PixArt is
licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products pursuant to an
existing cross-license agreement between us and PixArt, which license is limited to optical mouse
and optical mouse trackball products. We did not license to PixArt our patents for optical finger
navigation products. We intend to defend this action vigorously and to seek to have the scope of
the cross-license agreement properly construed by the court as excluding such products. We also
filed a counterclaim against PixArt on March&nbsp;31, 2010, asserting that PixArt has breached the terms
of the cross-license agreement between the parties. We are seeking a determination that PixArt is
not licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products, damages in an
unspecified amount, termination for breach, or rescission, of the license agreement and attorneys
fees.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2010 we filed a patent infringement action against ST Microelectronics NV in the
Eastern District of Texas for infringement of four of our patents related to optical navigation
devices. We amended the complaint on July&nbsp;6, 2010 adding infringement of a fifth optical navigation
related patent to the action. We are seeking injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount,
treble damages for willful infringement and attorneys fees. In response, ST Microelectronics filed
a patent infringement action against us in the Northern District of Texas alleging that our sales
of certain optical navigation devices infringed two ST Microelectronics&#146; patents. ST
Microelectronics is seeking injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. ST
Microelectronics filed a second suit against us on November&nbsp;5, 2010 in the Northern District of
California alleging certain anticompetitive actions by us in the optical navigation sensor market.
ST Microelectronics is seeking injunctive and compensatory relief under the Sherman Act and the
Clayton Act and attorneys fees. On January&nbsp;4, 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss ST Microelectronics&#146; claims relating
to anticompetitive actions by us. We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously,
and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional claims or counterclaims against ST
Microelectronics related to our intellectual property portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third-party intellectual
property rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers)
often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain.
Moreover, from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights.
Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex intellectual property
litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and
technical personnel.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. We review
and, where applicable, update our risk factors each quarter. The description set forth below
supersedes the description of the risk factors previously disclosed in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October&nbsp;31, 2010. These risk factors, which
could materially affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations, are not the
only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Business</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant
downturns.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid
technological change and price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles
(for semiconductors and for the end-user products in which they are used) and wide fluctuations in
product supply and demand. From time to time, these and other factors, together with changes in
general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and
in our business in particular. For example, the global semiconductor market experienced substantial
declines in 2001 and 2009, in each case beyond the declines experienced in the typical cycles
experienced by the semiconductor industry, due in large part to deteriorating global economic
conditions during those periods. Periods of industry downturns, including the recent economic
downturn, have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels
and periods of inventory adjustment, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue
mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, resulting in, an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, poor or worsening global
economic conditions may cause reductions in customer spending and could lead to the insolvency of
key suppliers resulting in product delays, customer insolvencies, and also counterparty failures
that may negatively impact our treasury operations, all of which may negatively affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. We expect our business to continue to be
subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in
the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of
factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could
materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant
amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales,
research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs. Any failure to adjust spending
quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such
revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of
our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, an immediate and significant decline in the
trading price of our ordinary shares may occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>If we do not adapt to technological changes in the semiconductor industry, we could lose customers
or market share.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is subject to constant and rapid changes in technology, frequent
new product introductions, short product life cycles, rapid product obsolescence and evolving
technical standards. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our products and
require unbudgeted upgrades that could be expensive and time consuming to implement. Our products
could become obsolete sooner than we expect because of faster than anticipated, or unanticipated,
changes in one or more of the technologies related to our products. Furthermore, we continually
evaluate expenditures for research and development and must choose among alternative technologies
based on our expectations of future market growth and other factors. We may be unable to develop
and introduce new or enhanced products that satisfy customer requirements and achieve market
acceptance in a timely manner or at all, the technologies where we have focused our research and
development expenditures may not become commercially successful, and we may be unable to anticipate
new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully
to new product announcements and introductions by competitors. If we fail to adapt successfully to
technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we may be unable to
retain customers, attract new customers or sell new products to our existing customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may
adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes
third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities. As a result, we are highly reliant on
third-party foundry wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity, including sole sourcing for
many components or products. For certain of our product families, substantially all of our revenue
from those products is derived from semiconductors fabricated by external foundries such as Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. and WIN Semiconductor Corp. We also use third-party
contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including
Amertron Incorporated, the Hana Microelectronics Public Company Ltd. group of companies, and SAE
Magnetics (HK)&nbsp;Ltd. The ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers to perform is largely
outside of our control. If one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to
perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring
products to market and our reputation could suffer. If one of our suppliers, particularly a
single-source supplier, ceases to, or is unable to, manufacture such a component or supply is
otherwise constrained, we may be forced to re-engineer a product or may fail to meet customer
demand. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or
increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. For example, in the event that
manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities, including as a response
by contract manufacturers to cycles in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing could be
disrupted, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, which could result in the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we operate using a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we do rely on
the manufacturing facilities we own, in particular our fabrication facilities in Fort Collins,
Colorado and Singapore. We maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our
innovative materials and processes, to protect our intellectual property and to develop the
technology for manufacturing. A prolonged disruption or material malfunction of, interruption in or
the loss of operations at one or more of our production facilities, especially our Fort Collins and
Singapore facilities, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these
facilities, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development
until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. The lease on our primary
internal fabrication facility in Singapore expires in 2015. If we are unable to renew this lease on
satisfactory terms, we would be required to locate suitable replacement premises, with the goal of
ensuring a smooth transition between facilities on or prior to the expiration of our current lease.
However, the replacement of this, or any other, manufacturing facility could take an extended
amount of time and significant expenditures on our part before manufacturing operations could
restart. While we would seek to minimize any disruption to our operations and supply chain
associated with any such changes in manufacturing facilities, we may experience delays and
significant costs resulting from these steps, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require advanced
equipment. We and our suppliers, as well as our competitors, continuously modify these processes in
an effort to improve yields and product performance. Defects or other difficulties in the
manufacturing process can reduce yields and increase costs. Our manufacturing efficiency will be an
important factor in our future financial performance, and we may be unable to maintain or increase
our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. For products that we outsource
manufacturing, our product yields and performance will be subject to the manufacturing efficiencies
of our third-party suppliers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we and our suppliers have experienced difficulty in beginning production at
new facilities, transferring production to other facilities, achieving and maintaining a high level
of process quality and effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes, all of which have
caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. We and our suppliers may
experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery
delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays,
transferring production to other facilities (as we may be required to do with our manufacturing
facility in Singapore, in or prior to 2015), upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing
our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of
operations could be adversely affected by any increase in costs related to increases in production

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are focused on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as &#147;design wins,&#148; to
develop semiconductors for use in our customers&#146; products. These selection processes are typically
lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate
scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the
competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant
design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our
products will likely have very short life cycles. Failure to obtain a design win sometimes prevents
us from offering an entire generation of a product. This can result in lost revenues and could
weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents,
copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers
and distributors their patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property
rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, we are currently involved
in a dispute with TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., or TriQuint, in which, among other things, TriQuint
is seeking a judgment that one of our patents relating to RF filter technology used in our wireless
products is invalid and, if valid, that TriQuint&#146;s products do not infringe that patent, and is
claiming that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents. See Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate these rights, regardless of
their merit or resolution, are frequently costly and divert the efforts and attention of our
management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our customer agreements and in some cases
our asset sale agreements require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party
intellectual property infringement claims, which have required and may in the future require that
we defend those claims, and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings.
Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future
customers from doing business with us. We do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings
given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation.
If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global semiconductor market is highly competitive. We compete in different target markets
to various degrees on the basis of, among other things, quality, technical performance, price,
product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering
expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery
timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support. Current and prospective customers
for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. Some of
our competitors are well established, have a more extensive product portfolio, have substantially
greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources
to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. In
addition, many of our competitors have longer independent operating histories, greater presence in
key markets, more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition. We compete with
integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the
internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. Our competitors range from large, international
companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in
narrow markets. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to
increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, companies
not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Because
our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be
integrated into more complex integrated circuits, or ICs, we also face competition from
manufacturers of ICs, as well as customers that develop their own IC products. The competitive
landscape is changing as a result of an increasing trend of consolidation within the industry, as
some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have
begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our
control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our
industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of
semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels.
The actions of our competitors, particularly in the area of pricing, can have a substantial adverse
impact on our revenues, and potentially on revenues in specific industry end markets. In periods
where the semiconductor industry experiences significant declines, manufacturers in financial
difficulties or in bankruptcy may implement pricing structures designed to ensure short-term market
share and near-term survival, rather than securing long-term viability. In addition, many of our
competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to
withstand adverse economic or market conditions and any associated pricing actions of other market
participants in the future.

affected customers for costs incurred related to product quality issues. For example, in the second
quarter of 2009 we identified a product quality issue with a particular component that we took
steps to correct, including notifying our customers and offering to replace such components. We are
continuing our discussions with affected customers regarding this issue, and have compensated or
otherwise rectified the issue with many of those customers. As at October&nbsp;31, 2010, we have
recorded $17&nbsp;million in charges associated with this issue, including $11&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2010, and may incur additional charges as we continue to work with our customers to resolve the
matter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we maintain product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to significant
deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect
against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. We may
incur costs and expenses in the event of any recall of a customer&#146;s product containing one of our
devices. The process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed
may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs,
contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Our customer contracts typically
contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases liquidated damages,
provisions relating to product quality issues. The potential liabilities associated with such
provisions are significant, and in some cases are potentially unlimited, and may greatly exceed any
revenues we receive from such products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in
connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially,
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

resources. Although our products are tested by our suppliers, our customers and ourselves, it is
possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs. If any of these problems are not found
until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur
additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. These problems may
also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For example, if a delay in the
manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer&#146;s product delivery, we may
be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for
the adverse effects of such delays. In addition, these problems may divert our technical and other
resources from other development efforts, and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in,
market acceptance of the affected product or products, and we could lose credibility with our

accurately estimate our customers&#146; demand could adversely affect our results of operations.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek
and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing,
personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements.
The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes
in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer
requirements. Our results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our supply chain
volume to address market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of
the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products is dependent, to a large degree, on
customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their
products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile and is subject to
seasonality related to the holiday selling season, making demand difficult to anticipate. On
occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can challenge our resources
and reduce margins. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or
components, or secure sufficient contract manufacturing capacity, to meet increasing product
demand, which could harm our reputation, prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities and
reduce revenue growth. In addition, some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers
due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into
non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors or make advance payments to suppliers, which could
reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. Prior
commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our products has
decreased. Downturns in the semiconductor industry have in the past caused, and may in the future
cause, our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products ordered from us. If demand for
our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be
forced to incur additional charges. Conversely, if OEMs order more of our products in any
particular quarter than are ultimately required to satisfy end customer demand, inventories at
these OEMs may grow in such quarter, which could adversely affect our product revenues in a
subsequent quarter as such OEMs would likely &#043;reduce future orders until their inventory levels
realign with end customer demand. In addition, because certain of our sales, research and
development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in
customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our customers are material to our business and results of operations. During fiscal
year 2010, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue, but our top 10 customers,
which included five distributors, collectively accounted for 55% of our net revenue. During the
first quarter of fiscal year 2011, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue, and
our top 10 customers, which included three distributors, collectively accounted for 52% of our net
revenue. We believe our top customers&#146; purchasing power has given them the ability to make greater
demands on their suppliers, including us. We expect this trend to continue, which we expect will
result in our results of operations becoming increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the
financial condition of, or other adverse developments related to, one or more of our significant
customers. Although we believe that our relationships with our major customers are good, we
generally do not have long-term contracts with any of them, which is typical of our industry. As a
result, although our customers provide indications of their product needs and purchases on an
annual basis, they generally purchase our products on a weekly or daily basis and the relationship,
as well as particular orders, can be terminated at any time. The loss of any of our major
customers, or any substantial reduction in sales to any of these customers, could have a material

materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers. For fiscal year 2010,
we purchased 54% of the materials for our manufacturing processes from eight suppliers. For the
first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we purchased 55% of the materials for our manufacturing process
from seven suppliers. Substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis, and we have
not generally entered into long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers. In the
event that these purchase orders or relationships with suppliers are terminated, we cannot obtain
sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices, the quality of the material

lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. From time to time,
suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or
other factors. Although we believe that our current supplies of materials are adequate, shortages
could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the
industry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use third-party contractor manufacturers for most of our manufacturing activities,
primarily for wafer fabrication and module assembly and test services. Our agreements with these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, with proprietary products and products
sold into our industrial and automotive target market typically providing higher gross margin than
other products. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products could adversely affect
our future gross margin percentages. In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant
capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. Although we
outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do retain some semiconductor
fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a high
level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in
higher average unit costs and lower gross margins. In the past, we have experienced periods where
our gross margins declined due to, among other things, reduced factory utilization resulting from
reduced customer demand, reduced selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower margin
devices. Increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering
requirements, lower demand and other factors may lead to further price erosion, lower revenues and
lower margins for us in the future.

replace the facility, and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and
development efforts in a particular product area or target market. In particular, any catastrophic
loss at our Fort Collins, Colorado and Singapore facilities would materially and adversely affect
our business.

jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable, or if our assumptions and
interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect,
the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax
holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For
example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an
agency of the Government of Singapore, which provide that certain classes of income we earn in
Singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each such tax
incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended,
modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other
incentives. In order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet certain operating
conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a treasury
function, a corporate headquarters function, specified intellectual property activities and
specified manufacturing activities in Singapore. Some of these operating conditions are subject to
phase-in periods through 2015. The Singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at
various dates generally between 2014 and 2025. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax
rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17% commencing from the 2010&nbsp;year of
assessment. For the fiscal years ended November&nbsp;1, 2009 and October&nbsp;31, 2010, the effect of all
these tax incentives, in the aggregate, was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from
what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately $17&nbsp;million and $63&nbsp;million,
respectively. The tax incentives that we have negotiated in other jurisdictions are also subject to
our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot or elect not to comply
with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related
tax benefits and could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with
respect to that incentive and, depending on the incentive at issue, could likely be required to
modify our operational structure and tax strategy. Any such modified structure or strategy may not
be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits
provided under the present tax concession arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing
authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives
are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial
consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our
cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our
operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an
arm&#146;s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm&#146;s length standard among taxing
authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by
tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense. We
are subject to, and are under, audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess
additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final
determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions
and accruals. The ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax bills are introduced from time to time to reform U.S. taxation of international business
activities. Depending on the final form of legislation enacted, if any, these consequences may be
significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities. If any of these
proposals are enacted into legislation, they could have material adverse consequences on the amount
of tax we pay and thereby on our financial position and results of operations.

results of operations.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses
that offer complementary products, services and technologies, augment our market coverage, or
enhance our technological capabilities. We may also enter into strategic alliances or joint
ventures to achieve these goals. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable
acquisition, investment, alliance, or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to
consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that
such transactions or relationships will be successful.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties.
For example, the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in
disruption to other parts of our business. In addition, the integration may require that we incur
significant restructuring charges. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage
the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of the integrations may be further
complicated by such factors as geographic distances, lack of experience operating in the geographic
market or industry sector of the acquired business, delays and challenges associated with
integrating the business with our existing businesses, diversion of management&#146;s attention from
daily operations of the business, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired
business, the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business,
performance problems with the acquired business&#146; technology, difficulties in entering markets in
which we have no or limited direct prior experience, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the
acquired business, insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the
acquisition, and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected
from any such acquisition. Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed
products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or
that all pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise
with respect to such acquired assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities, acquire goodwill and non-amortizable
intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges,
incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, increase our expenses and working
capital requirements, and subject us to litigation, which would reduce our return on invested
capital. Failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make could materially
harm our business and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which, in the case of
debt financing, would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings, and in the
case of equity financing, would be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any downgrades in our
credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by
resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be
able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent
as in the past, or at all. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated
levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an
acquisition, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business is subject to various significant international and U.S. laws and other legal
requirements, including packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These
regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. We
may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy
violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations
could result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or
impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to conduct our operations. In addition,
because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with
additional regulations in marketing our products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like
the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S.

regulations, our business could be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and
adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to

relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to, hazardous materials. Any failure
by us to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation
or suspension of production or subject us to future liabilities in excess of our reserves. In
addition, compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could restrict our ability
to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, incur other
significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes. In the event of the discovery of new
contamination, additional requirements with respect to existing contamination, or the imposition of
other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take remedial or

restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified
electronics products sold in the European Union as of July&nbsp;1, 2006 under the Restriction of
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Other countries, such as the
United States, China and Japan, have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to the EU
legislation. Other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize
components that are more environmentally compatible. Such reengineering and component substitution
may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, we
may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government
agencies and private parties. We may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future
alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. A significant judgment against
us could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing
on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and
certain illnesses, primarily different types of cancers. Regulatory agencies and industry
associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists. Because we
utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims. In addition, these reports may also

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2009, we pursued a number of restructuring initiatives designed to reduce
costs and increase revenue across our operations, in large part due to the global economic downturn
and related decline in demand for our customers&#146; products. These initiatives included significant
workforce reductions in certain areas as we realigned our business, establishing certain operations
closer in location to our global customers, evaluating functions more efficiently performed through
partnerships or other outside relationships and steps to attempt to further reduce our overhead
costs. As a result of these initiatives, we incurred restructuring charges of $34&nbsp;million in fiscal
year 2009 and $4&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be required to take additional charges in the future as we continue to evaluate our
operations and cost structures relative to general economic conditions, market demands, cost
competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers&#146; production
requirements. We cannot assure you as to the timing or amount of any future restructuring charges.
If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results,
financial condition, and cash flows may be adversely impacted. Additionally, there are other
potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays
encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work
stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.

distributors upon delivery to the distributor. We limit distributor return rights and we allow
limited price adjustments on sales to distributors. We provide reserves for distributor rights
related to these limited stock returns and price adjustments. Sales to distributors accounted for
41% and 38% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2011,

in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any
reason, such as due to the recent global recession or due to any downturn in technology spending,
our sales to these distributors and our revenues may decline. In addition, if distributors decide
to purchase more inventory in any particular quarter, due to product availability or other reasons,
than is required to satisfy end customer demand, inventory at our distributors may grow in such
quarter, which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such
distributors will likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end
customer demand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also face the risk that our distributors may for other reasons have inventory levels of our

our representatives and distributors may be terminated by either party at any time. As part of a
change in strategy, in order to more effectively manage sales representatives performance, in 2010
we terminated our relationships with a substantial number of our manufacturing representatives in
the United States and have replaced them with additional employee representatives. We continue to
evaluate our sales strategy and may make further changes in the future, which may include
terminating additional manufacturing representatives. Our future performance will depend, in part,
on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers&#146; representatives that will be
able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not
previously distributed our products, and on our ability to effectively transition sales efforts
from our terminated U.S. manufacturing representatives to our employee sales representatives. If we

restrictions on our business, including limitations on our ability to make investments and
acquisitions and sell assets, as well as requiring us to meet a financial ratio test. These
restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take
advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breach of covenants or restrictions in our credit agreement could result in a default
under the agreement. If we are unable to repay amounts due under the credit facility when due or in
the event of a default, the lenders under our senior credit agreement could proceed against the
collateral securing that debt. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. While we are actively negotiating a new
credit agreement with a view to replacing our existing revolving credit facility on or prior to its
expiration in December&nbsp;2011, we may be unable to negotiate a new revolving credit facility on
acceptable terms or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore, and certain of our officers

consolidated assets are located outside the United States. Although we are incorporated outside the
United States, we have agreed to accept service of process in the United States through our agent
designated for that purpose. Nevertheless, since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us
are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against us may
not be collectible within the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no treaty between the United States and Singapore providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for
the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws, would, therefore, not
be automatically enforceable in Singapore. There is doubt whether a Singapore court may impose
civil liability on us or our directors and officers who reside in Singapore in a suit brought in
the Singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal
securities laws of the United States, unless the facts surrounding such a violation would
constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Singapore law. Consequently, it may be difficult
for investors to enforce against us, our directors or our officers in Singapore judgments obtained
in the United States which are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States.

of directors. The Sponsors will continue to have a significant influence over our board of
directors and our affairs for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors and
significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets.
This will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result,
we may take actions that our non-Sponsor shareholders do not view as beneficial. For example, this
concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or
otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn
could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline or prevent our shareholders from
realizing a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares.

These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of

political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency
fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares. You may not realize
any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past,
companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, listing requirements of The
Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with
these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, make some
activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and
resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and
current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this
standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management&#146;s
attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may need to hire more employees
in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses. Furthermore, as we grow our business or
acquire new businesses, our internal controls will become more complex and we may require
significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls overall remain effective. Failure to
implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation,
could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and
public disclosure, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, are
creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and
making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to
varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their
application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and
governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and
higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to
invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may
result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management&#146;s time and
attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply
with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or
governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal
proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a public company makes it expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to

qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on committees of our board of

the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a
view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with
numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific
assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally
state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis
as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall
outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a
basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not
accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the
assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from
actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is
realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations
may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial
data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing,
investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><B>2011 Annual Cash Bonus Plan for Executives and Severance Agreement</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;8, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Avago Technologies
Limited, or the Board, elected to bifurcate the Company&#146;s annual cash incentive bonus plan for
fiscal year 2011 for executives and for non-executives, and adopted separate plans for each of
these two groups of employees. Other than as described below, the new 2011 Performance Bonus
Plan for Executive Employees (including our named executive officers) remains substantially similar to the
original 2011 annual cash incentive bonus plan approved by the Compensation Committee in December
2010. Under the new plan, to the extent that our Compensation Committee determines that Mr.&nbsp;Hock
Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has achieved individual performance at a level
greater than 100%, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, elect to pay the amount of
the bonus that is attributable to his individual performance in excess of 100% in the form of an
equity award under our 2009 Equity Incentive Award Plan, of a type and on such terms and conditions
as the Compensation Committee shall determine. The target bonus levels for our named executive
officers under the plan remain the same as for Fiscal Year 2010, other than for Ms.&nbsp;Patricia
McCall, our Vice President and General Counsel. The Compensation Committee approved an increase in
Ms.&nbsp;McCall&#146;s target bonus level from 40% to 50% of her of
base salary. The new 2011  Performance  Bonus Plan for
Executive Employees is filed as an exhibit
to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on March&nbsp;9, 2011, upon approval of the Compensation Committee, we entered into a
Severance Agreement with Bryan Ingram, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Wireless
Semiconductor Division. This agreement provides Mr.&nbsp;Ingram with severance in the event of the
termination of his employment without cause, because of death or disability or a resignation by him
for good reason, provided that, in each case, Mr.&nbsp;Ingram executes and does not revoke a general
release of all claims against us and our affiliates within 60&nbsp;days of any such termination. If the
termination of employment without cause, because of death or disability or resignation for good
reason takes place within 12&nbsp;months following a change in control, we will provide Mr.&nbsp;Ingram with
(a)&nbsp;12&nbsp;months of continued salary payments commencing on the sixtieth day following his separation
from us, (b)&nbsp;an amount equal to 100% of the lesser of Mr.&nbsp;Ingram&#146;s prior year&#146;s bonus or target
bonus payable in 12&nbsp;monthly installments commencing on the sixtieth day following his separation
from us, (c)&nbsp;12&nbsp;months accelerated vesting for those options held by Mr.&nbsp;Ingram which would
otherwise vest based upon the passage of time and his continued employment, and (d)&nbsp;the payment of
continued health, dental and vision insurance premiums for Mr.&nbsp;Ingram and any covered
dependents for 12&nbsp;months, or, if earlier, until Mr.&nbsp;Ingram is covered under similar plans of a new
employer. If Mr.&nbsp;Ingram&#146;s termination of employment without cause, because of death or disability
or a resignation for good reason takes place other than in connection with a change in control, Mr.
Ingram is entitled to (a)&nbsp;nine months of continued salary payments commencing on the sixtieth day
following his separation from us, (b)&nbsp;an amount equal to the lesser of 50% of his prior year&#146;s
bonus or target bonus payable in nine monthly installments commencing on the sixtieth day following
his separation from us, and (c)&nbsp;the payment of continued health, dental and vision insurance
premiums for Mr.&nbsp;Ingram and any covered dependents for six months, or, if earlier, until Mr.&nbsp;Ingram
is covered under similar plans of a new employer.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><B>Changes to Board of Directors</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective as of March&nbsp;9, 2011, James A. Davidson, David M. Kerko and Bock Seng Tan resigned as
members of the Board. The departure of these directors is due to a re-organization of the Board
resulting from the recent secondary offerings of our ordinary shares by our sponsor shareholders.
There were no disagreements between any of these directors and the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Davidson and Kerko were director designees of Silver Lake and KKR, respectively, and
Mr.&nbsp;Bock Seng Tan was originally the director designee of Seletar. Pursuant to the terms of
Avago&#146;s Second Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement, following the sale by Bali Investments
S.&#224;r.l, of Avago ordinary shares in a secondary offering in February&nbsp;2011, Silver Lake and KKR are
each currently entitled to designate only one member to the Board (prior to the offering they were
each entitled to designate two directors). Seletar ceased to be entitled to designate a member to
the Board following its sale of Avago ordinary shares in a secondary offering in December&nbsp;2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Davidson, Kerko and Bock Seng Tan were nominated for re-election to the Board at the
upcoming Avago Technologies Limited Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders,  or the 2011 AGM,
scheduled to take place on March&nbsp;30, 2011. In connection with their resignations from the Board
(i)&nbsp;each of Messrs.&nbsp;Davidson, Kerko and Bock Seng Tan has withdrawn as a candidate for re-election
as a director at the 2011 AGM, (ii)&nbsp;the Board has decided not to fill the vacancies created by
their resignations and no other nominees for election will be named
in  any of their places and
(iii)&nbsp;in light of the valuable service Mr.&nbsp;Kerko provided to the Company during his tenure as a
director, the Board accelerated the vesting and exercisability of 10,000 of the 30,000 unvested
option shares held by him to the effective date of his resignation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No votes received to date in respect of the re-election of Messrs.&nbsp;Davidson, Kerko and Bock
Seng Tan at the 2011 AGM will be counted for or against the election of these directors and the
proxies will not be voted in respect of their election at the 2011 AGM. The remaining seven
incumbent directors named in Avago Technologies Limited&#146;s definitive proxy statement for the 2011
AGM, or the proxy statement, continue as nominees for election at the 2011 AGM. Information
regarding those incumbent directors is contained in the proxy statement, which was distributed to
our shareholders and filed with the SEC on February&nbsp;22, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><B>Dividend</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;9, 2011, the Board declared an interim quarterly cash dividend on its ordinary shares
of $0.08 per share, payable on March&nbsp;30, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business
(5:00 p.m.), Eastern Time, on March&nbsp;18, 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><B>Amendment to Equity Incentive Plan for Senior Management Employees of Avago Technologies
Limited and Subsidiaries (Amended and Restated Effective as of April&nbsp;14, 2006)</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;9, 2011, the Board approved an amendment, effective immediately, to the Equity
Incentive Plan for Senior Management Employees of Avago Technologies Limited and Subsidiaries, as
amended and restated effective as of February&nbsp;25, 2008 and as further amended on July&nbsp;27, 2009,
eliminating entirely (i)&nbsp;the call rights, rights of first refusal and bring along rights in
favor of us and our controlling shareholders, and the put rights in favor of the non-employee
option holder, share purchase right holder or non-employee shareholder upon such individual&#146;s death
or permanent disability or, in some instances, termination of service and (ii)&nbsp;the restrictions on
the ability of non-employee option holders, share purchase right holders or non-employee
shareholders to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of our ordinary shares prior to the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant. These provisions were removed with respect to our employees by
the July&nbsp;2009 amendment of the plan.
